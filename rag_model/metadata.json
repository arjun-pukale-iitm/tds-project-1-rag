Deadline: Monday, March 31, 2025 6:29 PM\nAnswer: @s.anand @carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini Dear Sir, I have few questions. It is written in the Tools in Data Science that we can expose the api using vercel (the example given also uses vercel). But I don\u2019t think vercel can handle/allow many operations, some of them are listed below. In GA 1 ques 13 and  GA 2 Ques 7, we have to create github repo, then creating github actions and then retrieve the raw github file url. We can accomplish this using Github CLI gh which we have to install in the vercel instance using apt package manager. But, Vercel does not provide sudo access which is required to install packages. In GA 2 ques 10, we have to use local LLM (Llamafile), will vercel allow that? Also after that, we have to give answer as the ngrok public url for which we have to first install ngrok package. In GA 2 ques 8,  uploading an image to Dockerhub requires docker package installed. In GA 2 ques 6, Deploy a Python API to Vercel in a Vercel instance? Many ques require writing and running FastAPI server to serve data with CORS enabled. Can Vercel allow/do that? And many more Most tasks mentioned above like installing packages etc. requires sudo privilages or may face restrictions set by Vercel. Vercel does not provide sudo access or any form of root access to its hosting environment which is required to perform the above tasks. Many of these task can be done in our local systems (exposing to internet using cloudflare tunnels/ngrok), but we cannot run our systems 24*7 during evaluation. I can see only one option left that is renting a VPS from server providers like digitalocean, gcp, aws etc, which will provide us sudo access and 100% uptime. Also, some ques requires external toolings like In GA1 ques 5, it is written to explicitly use Excel and this will only work in Office 365. In GA1 ques 6, we have to use Devtools to show/find the hidden element in the question. Now, the question parameter in the POST request will be plain text, so how the element can hide there? GA 2 ques 4 and GA 2 ques 5 uses Google Colab specific python libraries like google.colab which can\u2019t be installed locally. How to solve these above questions that require explicit usage of external tools. Also, handling POST request for some questions are not clear like In GA 2 ques 2, we have to compress the image and upload the image as answer. So, now how to response such answer in json object. Should we encode the resultant compressed image as base64 string or Image URL or  Data URI. Some ques have images in them. For those images in GAs, I right clicked and used \u201cSave as\u201d to save the images and then done the required computations. So, now when this question will be sent as POST request, will the image be included as the base64 encoded string in the question parameter of the POST request itself or as an optional file attachment? Another concern is regarding the OpenAI API TOKEN, unlike Project 1, Project 2 does not have an API_TOKEN parameter in the POST request. Hence, the API TOKEN provided from https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev will be also used during evaluation. Now, what will happen if our API TOKEN credits gets end during evaluation. The LLM will throw errors then.

Deadline: Monday, March 31, 2025 6:29 PM\nAnswer: Hello Sir, I have a few questions. Would like your thoughts and suggestions over the same. Currently answers that we have entered for GA\u2019s 1 to 4 are not available and only for GA5 its available. It would be helpful for the project (when running the Curl command for each of the question) if the assignments can display the answers we\u2019ve entered as well for verification purposes. The first question of GA1 q1 needs for us to run vs code but when executing it through vercel its not possible because vercel is a serverless environment. In this case, is it okay to manually enter the answer in the code, so when the question is triggered it takes the manual output from the code. Can you provide some clarity as to how the question is supposed to be and structured ? Or should the code be able to handle multiple variants of the question? To address this concern, i tried to implement sentence_transformers using a lightweight model but the vercel application build failed saying that the data is too long and that Vercel serverless function deployment size exceeds the limit of 250 MB. Should i consider deploying elsewhere or change the approach?

For instance, I used the Gemini API key, integrated it with Python, and then formatted the results with the help of Copilot to achieve the desired outputs. Alternatively, do you want us to create a new LLM model and train it with questions from graded assignments? I\u2019m curious about your preference. Additionally, would you like the LLM to provide specific answers regarding computer specifications, or should it give general specifications? For example, in Graded Assignment 1, there is a question about the editor: Visual Studio Code. Your editor is the most important tool in your arsenal; that\u2019s where you\u2019ll spend most of your time, so make sure you\u2019re comfortable with it. Visual Studio Code is, by far, the most popular code editor today. According to the 2024 Stack Overflow Survey, almost 75% of developers use it. We recommend you learn it well. Even if you use another editor, you\u2019ll likely work with others who use VS Code, so having some exposure is beneficial. To get started, you can watch these introductory videos (totaling 35 minutes) from the Visual Studio Docs: Getting Started: Set up and learn the basics of Visual Studio Code (7 min) Code Editing: Learn how to edit and run code in VS Code (3 min) Productivity Tips: Become a VS Code power user with these productivity tips (4 min) Personalize: Personalize VS Code to make it yours with themes (2 min) Extensions: Add features, themes, and more to VS Code with extensions (4 min) Debugging: Get started with debugging in VS Code (6 min) Version Control: Learn how to use Git version control in VS Code (3 min) Customize: Learn how to customize your settings and keyboard shortcuts in VS Code (6 min) AI Editors: Copilot, Cursor Note: AI editors like Cursor, Cody, and GitHub Copilot use LLMs to help you write code faster. These tools are built on top of VS Code and have become standard in every developer\u2019s toolkit. Please make sure to use them. To install and run Visual Studio Code, open your Terminal (or Command Prompt) and type code -s , then press Enter. Copy and paste the entire output below. What is the output of code -s ? The output of code -s cannot be universally answered because it depends on the user\u2019s system and the specific version of VS Code installed. The question requests the output of a command that is unique to each user. As for the part about getting answers from the LLM model, I believe that may require using an AI agent.

So there is very little need for the use of LLMs or agents. Identify the the question being asked (how you do this is upto you, you can be as simplistic as using regex to look for some key words, or you can be clever and create embeddings out of the original question and calculate the similarity from the request) Create a function that solves the question with the required parameters and inputs. Remember this does not have to be fancy. Just compute the answer. You do not need to do the task as the GA required. You ONLY want the answer. No tools required. Just a computed answer. Give the answer back as specified.

I am facing issue with zip file extraction function which is in many GA1 questions. e.g., for GA1 Q15, if I use 7-zip to extract files, it shows the correct total size when using Postman for local server. If I use python built-in function, it calculates a different value (which is incorrect). So, I used 7-zip. But I (with help from copilot agent) am not able to make 7-zip work on the vercel deployment. Can we just hard code the answers to GA1 questions, or is there a way to take answer from local server and use it for response in vercel (sorry, it doesn\u2019t even make sense to me, but a lot of things are hard to understand anyway)? Or how do we resolve this 7-zip issue. Python built-in extraction did not work correctly even after hours of trying.. I have another question.

Reference: GA4 Q2 and Q10 resolution Output Formatting (Multiple Questions) Issue: When using plain text, the answer is accepted. However, in JSON format, newline characters (\\n) and backslashes are added. Note: As per the project requirement, the output should be in JSON like {\u201canswer\u201d: \u201cresult\u201d}. But directly copy-pasting such a result with special characters leads to rejection by the portal. Vercel / Docker Hub / Ngrok Deployment Questions Issue: Some deployment-related questions require a **live-running server, which needs real-time manual deployment using platforms like Vercel or Ngrok. Clarification needed: How is this expected to be evaluated? Deployment-Related Issues (To Be Included in Thursday\u2019s Session) Please include discussion and solutions for the following deployment issues: Platform Capability for GA Tasks Which cloud platform (Azure, DigitalOcean, etc.) can handle all GA tasks reliably? Note: Some platforms have limitations that block certain tasks or token usage. File Upload Example via Platform API Request: Please provide examples for both small and large file uploads using API from a cloud-deployed app. This would help validate deployments for assignment questions involving file input. General Observations on GA1-5 Output Accuracy: Approximately 80% of the questions in GA1-5 return correct output when tested on a local machine. However, about 20% either have portal-side issues or deployment-related problems.

Our parser will only work if encodings for the formatting are present in the response. If there are no encodings (invisible or visible) then we will not have the correctly formatted file. Please review module 1 for a better understanding about how text is encoded. Especially invisible characters. The browser is designed for user friendliness. Thats why the characters are invisible when you copy paste string with newlines. But it exists. The programmatic strings show invisible encodings as escaped characters. (Usually) To check if a string has invisible characters, # Multi-line string\nmy_string = \"\"\"Hello\nWorld    with    spaces \nand some newlines\nand a tab\t\"\"\"\n\n# Print ASCII values of each character\nprint([ord(c) for c in my_string]) e.g., newline = 10, tab = 9 This is a great way to check what we are receiving when you send us some response, import requests\nimport json\n\n# This is just an example server to see what we see.\n\nurl = \"https://httpbin.org/post\"\n\nmy_multiline_string_answer = \"\"\"This is a multiline\nstring that spans\nmultiple lines    with    spaces \nand some newlines\nand a tab\tas well.\"\"\"\n\nresponse_to_send_to_tds_evaluator = {\n\"answer\": my_multiline_string_answer\n}\n\n# Send the JSON data\nresponse = requests.post (url, json=response_to_send_to_tds_evaluator)\n\n# Check the response\nprint (response.status_code)\nprint (response.json ())\nprint (response.text)\n\n# Do other checks as necessary... See what happens when I print the result print (json.loads (response.text)['json']['answer']) Screenshot 2025-03-27 at 1.09.56 pm 323\u00d7120 3.61 KB Its a proper multiline correctly formatted text! The encodings are invisible just like in the original as well as in your clipboard when you copy paste into the GA. Here is a json example: json_answer = {\n    \"mary\": \"poppins\",\n    \"age\": 42\n}\n\nstringed_json = json.dumps (json_answer)\nresponse_to_send_to_tds_evaluator = {\n\"answer\": stringed_json\n}\n\nresponse = requests.post (url, json=response_to_send_to_tds_evaluator)\n\nprint (json.loads (response.text)['json']['answer']) Look at the response.

Deadline: Monday, March 31, 2025 6:29 PM\nAnswer: @carlton , @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini GA2 - Question 3: Publish a Page Using GitHub Pages As part of the requirement, I successfully published a webpage using GitHub Pages that includes my email address 21f3001076@ds.study.iitm.ac.in in the HTML content. The page functions correctly and becomes accessible on my local system. To automate the publishing process, I implemented a delay function that checks for the page\u2019s availability after 5 seconds. Based on testing, GitHub Pages typically take around 10\u201320 seconds to go live after repository creation and HTML deployment. As a result, the complete process\u2014from initiating the API call to verifying that the page is live\u2014takes approximately 30 seconds locally. This setup works reliably on my local machine. However, when deploying the same process on Azure, I encountered an issue. Without the delay, the API responds too quickly\u2014before the GitHub Pages site is actually live\u2014resulting in a broken or non-functional link on the assignment portal. On the other hand, including the delay function causes Azure to throw a 502 Bad Gateway error, likely due to Azure\u2019s request timeout limitations. The additional wait time slightly exceeds the platform\u2019s allowed response duration. GA4 - Question 9: Process PDF Files A similar issue occurs in GA4 Question 9, where the task involves processing PDF files. While this works perfectly in the local environment, it leads to a 502 Bad Gateway error on Azure. This is due to the relatively long time required to parse and analyze the PDFs, which again exceeds Azure\u2019s execution time limit. Moreover, pre-processing the PDF files is not an option because the input varies for each user. Therefore, the PDFs must be processed dynamically, which adds to the delay and contributes to the timeout problem. Currently, I am using Azure for deployment, and for the majority of tasks, it works reliably. Although these specific tasks face timeout issues, shifting to another deployment platform is not feasible at this point. I am not certain if alternative platforms will work consistently across all questions, and making such a change could introduce failures in other parts of the assignment where Azure performs well.

Deadline: Monday, March 31, 2025 6:29 PM\nAnswer: @s.anand @carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini Final Thoughts on Project 2 Project 2 has been a valuable yet challenging experience. I\u2019d like to share a few reflections\u2014not as criticism, but as constructive feedback with the intention to contribute positively to future iterations. Organization & Structure: The project felt a bit unstructured at times, which may be expected given that this is possibly the first time such an initiative is being carried out. I\u2019m not blaming anyone\u2014just sharing my thoughts. I hope positive insights can be drawn from this feedback. Deployment & Portal Limitations: There are noticeable limitations on the deployment side (e.g., timeouts, platform constraints) and occasional issues on the assignment portal. While frustrating, these also led to some deep technical learning. Time Constraints: Balancing this project with ongoing coursework and other responsibilities has been quite demanding. The deadline of March 31st adds pressure, making it difficult to thoroughly test all 57 questions across different environments. Sessions & Support: The sessions conducted were helpful in addressing specific topics, but in many areas, I had to rely heavily on GPT and self-guided exploration to move forward. Deployment Variability: Each GA\u2019s questions seemed to expose different limitations depending on the deployment platform. This inconsistency made it hard to predict which questions would work reliably. Effort Acknowledgment: I sincerely appreciate the efforts of the TAs and instructors\u2014it\u2019s clear that a lot of hard work went into enabling and supporting this project. However, it\u2019s also a bit disappointing that we, as students, are unsure which questions are expected to work and which may fail\u2014even the team might not have full visibility over this at the moment. Feasibility in the Given Timeline: Even for someone with a technical background, it\u2019s difficult to troubleshoot and experiment across so many cases within the current timeline. Trying different approaches per question isn\u2019t always feasible before the deadline. I genuinely hope someone is able to complete all 57 questions successfully\u2014I\u2019d love to learn from their experience and solutions.

Deadline: Monday, March 31, 2025 6:29 PM\nAnswer: Hello Sir, I want to express my gratitude for the opportunity to work on this project. I have developed a mini chatbot backend using vicky_server.py , which handles question matching and execution internally, producing appropriate responses. My mini chatbot is capable of creating its own API using REST and can manage tasks such as image compression, repository management, workflows, and web scraping related to graded assignments. It can even calculate total marks for subjects like physics and convert PDFs into markdown content. Additionally, it is capable of downloading the Llama model and creating a tunnel using ngrok. Essentially, it can address the first four assignment questions. However, there are some limitations to this project. Currently, it processes my local files instead of the uploaded PDFs. I am working on resolving this issue, but I have some confusion regarding the internal handling of uploaded files. When I pass a PDF or file through an upload method, how should the system proceed? I want to ensure that the file is treated as a PDF for the user rather than just being referenced as \u201cquestion.pdf.\u201d How can I effectively manage this problem? Furthermore, there is an issue with question matching. At times, the system incorrectly identifies questions containing the word \u201ccode\u201d and executes first.py for GA1.

Specifically: Make sure you pass an Authorization header with dummy API key. Use gpt-4o-mini as the model. The first message must be a system message asking the LLM to analyze the sentiment of the text. Make sure you mention GOOD, BAD, or NEUTRAL as the categories. The second message must be exactly the text contained above. This test is crucial for DataSentinel Inc. as it validates both the API integration and the correctness of message formatting in a controlled environment. Once verified, the same mechanism will be used to process genuine customer feedback, ensuring that the sentiment analysis module reliably categorizes data as GOOD, BAD, or NEUTRAL. This reliability is essential for maintaining high operational standards and swift response times in real-world applications. Note : This uses a dummy httpx library, not the real one.

Our teachers don\u2019t have enough time to make a separate video for project to explain what to do and how to do? I already have done two project courses and they taught us, even they made 2 - groups just only for discussions in which one is personal and also made a YouTube playlist especially for project. They explained what should be your approach? How to make project? And here, they took only one session just only for show off. And they organised that single session when too many student requests too many times? Are we studying in IIT - The top institute of India or in a cheap and lower than third class government schools. It is the responsibility of our teachers to explain the project, but they are just showing off. Even they never provided the solutions for assignments also. Is it not our right to get solutions so that we can know where we did mistake? They don\u2019t have time to make solutions, they just made an assignment checker which checks the assignments automatically. I don\u2019t think so that they really made any effort in our course. In project-2 also, we need solutions for all graded assignments and so many students request for solutions but our the great teachers ignores the request and didn\u2019t provide the solutions. I think they provide the projects whatever comes in their dreams during sleeping. In weekly study material, don\u2019t have their notes, even they have a very few videos made by them, they just render to other YouTuber\u2019s Youtube videos and online websites. Are we paid just only for these YouTube videos ? If we can understand everything just only from YouTube then why we are studying from the India\u2019s top Engineering institute - The IIT Madras? I have much more better videos than that are provided on YouTube and created by other YouTubers. They only have some points copy pasted from documentations, but they never tried to explain them. Just read, copy and paste in your program. What is it, why it is used for, don\u2019t ask anything. Some students request for extending the time limit of [roject-2 just only for one day, but what was their excuse- \"We won\u2019t be able to extend deadline, if we do, then evaluations will get delayed. \". I want to ask them, where is the result of Project-1? The first date of result declaration was 26-Feb, then their another date was 16-March, but until now on 2-Apr, we do not get our results. It is more than 45 days, what is this going on? Nobody tried to ask with our great teachers. But on extending the deadline of project-2 just only for one day, their evaluation will be late. In project-2, we have to continue running our project until they will not evaluate, whether they take more than 1, 2 or more months. Either we have to host online by paying or run our own system for 24x7 unto when, we also don;t know as their result date is also not fixed, it is just a combination of letters and numbers showing on portal. It is our tales it is my right to get solutions for every weekly assignment, but don\u2019t ask them to make efforts. Just pay and do assignments at own risk even you have not understand anything from the copy-pasted material. Just use AI\u2019s or read whatever and wherever you want to read.

What is this going on? Is it joking? Our teachers don\u2019t have enough time to make a separate video for project to explain what to do and how to do? I already have done two project courses and they taught us\nAnswer: Dear Shahzada, You joined Discourse almost a year ago Jun 8th, 2023. In all that time you have read 832 posts. And never interacted with anyone on discourse. You finally decided to interact once and that was today and this is your first post (your second if we count that you deleted your first post) The first step to receiving help is communication. If you do not communicate, no one can help you. 23f2002668: What is this going on? Is it joking? I am not sure what your question is. I am not sure what you are referring to. Please be clear in your questions. 23f2002668: Our teachers don\u2019t have enough time to make a separate video for project to explain what to do and how to do? We have made several hours of videos on Project 2 and have demonstrated multiple ways to solve it. However, we are not going to ever create it for you. We do teach you all the core technologies you can leverage to create it yourself. 23f2002668: I already have done two project courses and they taught us, even they made 2 - groups just only for discussions in which one is personal and also made a YouTube playlist especially for project. Not sure which courses you are referring to, but those are standalone courses. Here project is part of the course and is meant to take you roughly a few days to create. We gave students more than one month for Project 1 and the solution for it takes a few hours to create. (which we have shared) 23f2002668: They explained what should be your approach? How to make project? Yes these were explained if you either took part in any live session or watched the recorded video 23f2002668: And here, they took only one session just only for show off. And they organised that single session when too many student requests too many times? I am not sure what you are referring to because several sessions were conducted for Project 2 spanning nearly 2 weeks. 23f2002668: It is the responsibility of our teachers to explain the project, but they are just showing off. Project 2 was explained. I can summarise it in these words: Create a server api that receives a request. The request would be any question from the first 5 GAs. The response has to be a json response as specified in the Project page. Multiple demonstrations were done of this workflow in sessions. 23f2002668: Even they never provided the solutions for assignments also. Is it not our right to get solutions so that we can know where we did mistake? Since this is your first post, you\u2019ve never ever asked for solutions to any assignments. We have never provided solution notebooks for TDS. It defeats the learning process. If you want solutions, there are several options: Ask for help (since you have never posted before, you missed the opportunity to receive it) Collaborate with others (a bigger goal of TDS, because in the real world one man bands almost certainly fail with extremely high probability, barring a few exceptions, human progress is built on collaboration) Join live sessions, where we have provided solutions to almost every assignment question that students have asked (and not asked) Watch the live sessions, we have even created neat Q & A summaries for them on the TDS portal (something which no other subject does at the moment) 23f2002668: They don\u2019t have time to make solutions, they just made an assignment checker which checks the assignments automatically. This is one of the most loved features by our students. No other GA in any other course gives you the option to check your answers in real time and better yet correct them before submitting. The biggest clue for solutions is in this nugget. If you take the opportunity, and enterprise and get some fellow students together, you are actually able to obtain the solution script from the GA page itself. It takes some effort, but that is how learning occurs\u2026 with effort. Studies repeatedly show that zero effort results in nearly zero learning. 23f2002668: Are we paid just only for these YouTube videos ? If we can understand everything just only from YouTube then why we are studying from the India\u2019s top Engineering institute - The IIT Madras? I have much more better videos than that are provided on YouTube and created by other YouTubers. If you had better resources available, you have hardly been the paragon of virtue, because we always encourage people to share their learnings. We learn from you, just as you learn from us. If someone makes a better video than us and give it for free, we are happy enough to learn from them. Why should we reinvent a video that is poor quality and force students to watch it when there are better videos? We are not so egoistic to take that approach and worse it does not benefit our students to satisfy our ego. There are a million videos out there on you Tube, how do you find the best one? We curate it. So that you do not have to spend hours finding a good video. But feel free to find better videos. More power to you, but what would be even better? Share with others so that we can build each other up. What are the best videos to learn linear algebra? Probably MIT. Why bother with substandard videos when you can just get the best for free? Its just that watching MIT videos will not give you an undergraduate degree from MIT. And it costs Rs. 2.7 crores, provided you even get a seat in the first place. Here you get a 4 year degree for Rs 3.5 lakhs. So you are paying for that. I absolutely 100% agree with you, if you think you can get a better degree for Rs 3.5 Lakhs then definitely do that. There is no point in wasting time and money on something that is not delivering good value to you. 23f2002668: They only have some points copy pasted from documentations, but they never tried to explain them. Just read, copy and paste in your program. What is it, why it is used for, don\u2019t ask anything. Reading documentation is a skill you have to pick up. Having said that, we have always explained something that students have asked. Just ask anyone who attended the sessions. More significantly, most of the new things we learnt, were self taught. Unless you pick up this lifelong habit, you will struggle in the real world. Now is a good time to start. 23f2002668: Some students request for extending the time limit of [roject-2 just only for one day, but what was their excuse- \"We won\u2019t be able to extend deadline, if we do, then evaluations will get delayed. \" That is correct. We do not want to evaluations for Project 2 to be delayed as end term is very close. Is your complaint that you want evaluations to be delayed? Also its not an excuse. Its a fact. Delaying submissions, delays evaluations. Its just basic logic. 23f2002668: I want to ask them, where is the result of Project-1? They have already been sent to all those who passed the prerequisites. Yours did not pass the first time. Luckily for you, our first priority is always to do our best for students. So not being satisfied with the validation script that was run which was stricter, we created a new one that was more forgiving. You should get a 0 based on the stricter criteria, but you passed on our more lenient check and now you will soon be getting a normalised 7/20 score (we have not decided the normalisation yet because its a matter of deciding how lenient to be). 23f2002668: The first date of result declaration was 26-Feb, then their another date was 16-March, but until now on 2-Apr, we do not get our results. It is more than 45 days, what is this going on? Nobody tried to ask with our great teachers. If you had attended the live session you would have seen Anand explain the reason for the delay. And we do not mind when students ask why and we freely tell them why. So I do not understand how you came to this conclusion. 23f2002668: In project-2, we have to continue running our project until they will not evaluate, whether they take more than 1, 2 or more months. Either we have to host online by paying or run our own system for 24x7 unto when, we also don;t know as their result date is also not fixed, it is just a combination of letters and numbers showing on portal. Anand invited students to write the evaluation script in his live session. And since you claim it is so easy you could have written it and gotten full marks. I am not sure why you did not take this easy option. You complained about it, but decided not to create a solution? Also if you watched the sessions, we never asked you to run your server for 2 months or 1 month  etc. Its generally a bad idea to make assumptions that have no basis in reality. Project 2 is easy to evaluate. We expect it will take a few days, possibly by this weekend to finish evaluation and push a score. So why you came to the conclusion it would take months, is a mystery, given that you already rightfully explained that its easy to write a script. But validation takes time. We want to make sure there are no bugs and errors and a lot of edges are possible when students are running various deployments. So we want to give them the best chance of actually scoring. Unless you prefer we do a rush job and give them zeros. You would have received a zero in your project 1 had we not caught a few edge cases in our testing regime. You can take a poll and ask fellow students if they prefer your approach. We are always happy to make changes based on feedback. 23f2002668: It is my kind request, our term is going to be completed, but please make some efforts in next term. Thankyou to all my respected \u2018The Great Teachers\u2019. I am glad you decided make a kind request, although by all the personal insults and attacks and your ending sign off its clear that neither respect nor kindness is evident in your post. But thank you for your feedback. One final note: Do interact more, its healthy. We make mistakes, and we learn. There are many things we want fix for next term. Its not at all our desire to delay evaluations. The complexity of project 1 evaluations was unexpected. So we do apologise for that. We have done so repeatedly, even in our sessions and in discourse posts. The scripts that we released for everyone, probably showed how challenging it was to get it right so that everyone who could get a score, got a score. And when writing posts or emails or any communication, try to stay on point and professional. We are always happy to learn what we can change and improve.

What is this going on? Is it joking? Our teachers don\u2019t have enough time to make a separate video for project to explain what to do and how to do? I already have done two project courses and they taught us\nAnswer: Hi, I have a few things to say My background : I have completed all the courses in diploma except TDS. I have secured reasonably good grades in all the courses. However, I failed TDS the last term and I am likely to fail in this term too. The reason is, I got bad marks in both ROE and I have never submitted any project, i.e., I have not submitted 3 TDS projects in the last two terms and did badly in the first project of the previous term. My Initial Disappointments with this Course In one of the orientation session, I heard Andrew sir say this (subject to correction): The video lectures are the primary content. It is not compulsory to attend the live sessions, but it is highly recommended. Here, the most important resource are the live sessions. I did not like it. Till now, I have managed all the courses with faculty lectures alone. I rarely watch live sessions. I didn\u2019t like watching live sessions. I felt it was against what is pointed out in the previous paragraph ROE is just for forty five minutes, with around 10 questions. I felt that this is rubbish and unthoughtful. There are not many videos explaining the tools (from IIT side). Only a few videos. Most of the tools are explained through text. I felt that a the purpose of a college course is to explain things in a simple way so that we can learn it easily. Why did I fail? Last Term I dumped myself with a 3 more courses, projects and nptel courses. I didn\u2019t practice the GAs properly. So I failed ROE. I will come to the projects soon. This term. I made sure that I do all the GAs properly. But I did better than last time in ROE but still bad. This time because, other than GAs, I didn\u2019t allocate time for ROE. Also, I didn\u2019t submit both the projects. In both the terms I didn\u2019t collaborate with anyone. I felt that I shouldn\u2019t earn my marks be talking help from someone. I felt it is not fair. Me Understanding about the Course Now This one line changed my view about ROE. On another topic What does this RoE evaluate? Implicit learning. I am reasonably ok with python and all the tools in this course. But in ROE, I was not able to write a nested for loop, which was needed for some question. It is not that I don\u2019t know how to write a simple nested loop. I discovered the fact that I have not coded enough. I scored 100 in all the OPPEs : python, java, PDSA, DBMS. I knew the concepts. But the questions were not difficult and the time was ample. This is not the case in TDS. Now I realize that  I am not good in SQL or DSA. It is just the questions were easy and was accompanied with ample time. In MLP, I score just 40 in OPPE 1, this was because of me not practicing SKLearn . Then I practiced and got 90 in the second OPPE. This course has made me realise that till I need to learn relearn these things in an implicit way. This is the exact reason why I have not been able to complete the projects. I still know most of the things required for project 1 and 2. But I was not able to practically sit and write the code. I have understood that this is not a traditional course. I feel that we must expect something different from this course. Especially not just marks I have understood that the limited amount of recorded lectures for is a way to make the students to practically go through the documentation. Understand the complex phrasing of some functionalities, etc. I am most likely to take this course again. I feel extremely bad to have wasted 15000 rupees. But this course has been a wake up call for me. I still feel that I have the potential to do this course way better than this. What I would have to do is a lot more coding of what I have already learnt. From the other project courses, I had a wrong assumption that projects are about applying what we have learnt. This was also a reason why I didn\u2019t do my projects in TDS. I felt that the course team didn\u2019t cover all the essentials of a projects. I have now realized that projects are about applying what we know and also learn new things which will enhance our projects. Since this is not a traditional course, I also feel that it is fine to collaborate and seek help, at the same time, strive to contribute to others too. Thanks to @s.anand , @carlton , @Jivraj and @Saransh_Saini Just two suggestions I feel that MAD 2 and MLP should be corequisites.

Deadline: Monday, March 31, 2025 6:29 PM\nAnswer: : From Problem to Platform: Building \u201cVicky\u201d \u2013 A Smart Data Science Assistant for TDS @ IIT Madras Project Demo Website : https://app.algsoch.tech During our college course Tool for Data Science (TDS) at IIT Madras , we were tasked with a challenging but exciting project: to build a platform that can take in natural language questions and execute corresponding solutions through an API . The Mission: Create a tool that behaves like a chatbot , accepts user queries (text or file-based) via web or API , processes them intelligently, executes the appropriate code , and returns accurate results\u2014like a real data science assistant. The Journey: From Fails to Final At first, the natural choice was to try LLM agents \u2014they sounded magical. But in real-world usage, they were slow, unreliable, and lacked precision. Most failed to parse or execute even moderately dynamic queries. Then I thought\u2014what if I manually mapped questions and answers using a static JSON structure ? That quickly broke when users passed different parameters, different files , or queried in non-standard formats like \u201ccode -s\u201d or \u201ccode -v\u201d. The next idea: write individual Python scripts per question from our Graded Assignments (GA1\u2013GA5). But that lacked flexibility and reusability. Creating multiple files became unmanageable and non-scalable. The Breakthrough: Dynamic Function Mapping After multiple iterations and failed prototypes, I finally found the right architecture: Centralized engine in vicky_server.py Uses regex-based pattern matching to detect question types, extract parameters, and identify the correct solution Each solution is a structured Python function like ga1_first_solution(query=None) Supports dynamic parameter injection, command-line variations, file-based queries, and more Acts like a mini compiler for data science tools Presenting Vicky \u2013 The Mini Chatbot for TDS Vicky is a smart, modular chatbot built specifically for Tool for Data Science at IIT Madras . It\u2019s packed with real functionality\u2014not just templates. Key Features: Graded Assignment Solver Handles dynamic, real-world questions from GA1 to GA5 like: code -s / code -v \u2192 VS terminal commands Create FastAPI API for CSV with filtering/searching GitHub automation: repo creation, GitHub Actions setup Data cleaning, scraping from IMDb, image compression File Upload with Query Matching Users can upload a file (CSV, JSON, Excel) and ask file-specific queries. The system understands context and dynamically links the query to the uploaded file. HTML Viewer + Base64 Decoder View any website in rendered & source format using CORS proxy Upload Base64 string \u2192 Get original image back Webhooks Integration Live notifications via Discord & Slack whenever /api endpoints are accessed Monitors server status (online/offline) and sends real-time updates LLM Download + Auto Tunneling Downloads LLaMA models Dynamically finds available ports Creates and exposes tunneled endpoints Live Web UI at app.algsoch.tech Ask any TDS question Upload and query with files Image decoder Graded assignment slider navigation HTML viewer API health status Built With: FastAPI for blazing fast APIs Regex & Pattern Matching for dynamic input detection GitHub Copilot + my Python debugging and architectural thinking Full webhook and status monitoring system Modular backend ( vicky_server.py ) and web frontend ( vicky_app.py ) I want to extend a huge thank you to @s.anand for their guidance on this project. I\u2019ve learned what prompt engineering is and how we can leverage large language models (LLMs). One interesting takeaway is that while these technologies won\u2019t replace our jobs\u2014especially for those who understand programming\u2014they will create new job opportunities instead.

Initially, I provided an ngrok link, but due to an error with ngrok, it stopped working. I then found an alternative solution using Cloudflare with a custom domain that I obtained through the GitHub Student Pack. I successfully created a tunnel, and it is currently functional. I can shut down my laptop, and it still works with the same URL when I restart. I hope you will consider my case.

(unless you chose to edit your response, in that situation i have not tested what actually happens).\nAnswer: Hi @carlton The same issue has affected several of us. During the last Google Meet session, we explained the situation to @Saransh_Saini . It seems that when we edit our responses, the timestamp with other values updates not submitted as new response. However, the position of the response in the form remains unchanged. For instance, we submitted our response at 11:30 PM on March 31st, and someone else submitted theirs at 11:45 PM. Even after editing our response the next day, our entry still appears above theirs. We just wanted to clarify: Will responses edited or submitted on April 1st still be considered, given that the form remains open? If not, is there any way we can show proof of our original submission? Currently, we have email confirmations for both the initial and the edited responses. We hope this won\u2019t be a major issue, especially not on the level of Project 1 concerns. Looking forward to a positive resolution from the TDS team.

I mentioned the exactly correct URL of my app in the form but the evaluation logs show three different types of URL to which request was made. As I mentioned in the form, my url is of the format \u201chttps://\u2026/api/\u201d and allows only POST requests. The app was supposed to allow POST requests and I allowed only POST requests, so GET requests even to correct url resulted in 405 response When POST requests were actually made, two wrong urls were used for all the POST requests a. http://\u2026/api/ \u2192 resulted in 302 response b. https://\u2026/api  \u2192 resulted in a 307 whereas the url I gave was of the format \u201chttps://\u2026/api/\u201d The logs from Cloud Run image 982\u00d7552 133 KB As you can see from the above logs, all POST requests made to my app have the wrong url, some have only http and some end with \u201c/api\u201d instead of \u201c/api/\u201d, both of which do not match with the correct url I gave in the Google Form (screenshot attached below). image 831\u00d7645 41.7 KB I request you to re-evaluate my project 2 with the correct url exactly as I had submitted in the Google Form.

However, I have not received any such communication on my end.

For your verification, I am attaching screenshots of my GitHub repository and the Vercel deployment dashboard, which clearly show the deployment. I sincerely request you to kindly consider this issue. This situation has caused significant mental stress, especially as I had already faced a grading issue in Project 1. The anxiety and uncertainty around my Project 2 score have negatively affected my focus during the end-term exam and viva for other projects as well.

The API becomes accessible when using public DNS services like Google (8.8.8.8) or Cloudflare (1.1.1.1) . This suggests that the current deployment environment may be using a restricted or unreliable DNS resolver, which causes access issues on some networks (e.g., Jio). Suggested Fix: To ensure reliable access for all students, could you please consider updating the deployment or testing environment to use a public DNS provider?

I notice that I am not providing a preloaded answer when this question arises. Instead, it creates a new repository and an HTML file, then deploys it on GitHub. Initially, it presents a URL, but I understand that your server checks to verify whether the URL contains valid HTML. This verification process takes time, which can lead to an incorrect response when checking the URL right after deployment. At that moment, the URL might not display the HTML content or be verified by your server, even though eventually, the deployment is successful and the URL is correct. Please keep in mind that publishing to GitHub requires some time; it\u2019s not feasible to expedite this process drastically, to my knowledge.

Here\u2019s the actual response I got using this cURL command: curl -X POST https://app.algsoch.tech/api/ \\ -H \u201caccept: application/json\u201d \\ -F \u201cquestion=\u2026How many times does XF appear as a key?\u201d \\ -F \u201cfile=@E:\\data science tool\\GA5\\q-extract-nested-json-keys.json\u201d API Output:{\u201canswer\u201d:\u201c14602\u201d} This indicates that my logic worked correctly and the key XF appeared 14,602 times, exactly as intended. What Went Wrong on API Side: The API returned a parsing error, indicating: \u201cinvalid literal for int() with base 10: \u2018Error: Invalid JSON in the file\u2026\u2019\u201d However: My file was valid JSON, properly parsed. The actual issue seems to be on the API\u2019s side \u2014 possibly mishandling the file read or decoding before passing it to the evaluator. It may have expected an integer but received a string-wrapped error or non-integer data, causing it to crash. Insight: If the original question was about counting the key XF, my solution was 100% correct. However, if the question dynamically changed the key name or added extra criteria (e.g., only count if value == true, or only under a certain section), then the result might differ. But from the default XF-focused question, my logic and result match perfectly.", "Title: Project 2 - TDS Solver - Discussion Thread\nQuestion: Please post any questions related to Project 2 - TDS Solver .

Project-1 Evaluation Sir, For the project 1, I have written the code, uploaded in GitHub and the dockerfile image is created and uploaded successfully. Sir, I already contacted regarding Project - 1, you said to check it by replicating the test environment. I did till running the dockerfile but I needed evaluate.py sir, which I didn\u2019t get it. I got only 5 marks sir. Can you please check my code once sir and verify it as I have written the code and the dockerfile is running successfully. Project-2 Evaluation Regarding project 2 also, I have uploaded my code in GitHub and deployed my app in Vercel. But, I got 0 sir. Can you check my code once again and verify it? According to the guidance given, I deployed my app through Vercel. The app got deployed but I am getting 404 Error, even after trying any troubleshooting method. Maybe, Vercel is in development stage. Sir, but I wrote the code and deployed, but I got 0 marks only. Please check it and guide me to get it corrected.

Deadline: Monday, March 31, 2025 6:29 PM\nAnswer: @s.anand Subject: Request to Share My Student-Built TDS Assistant Platform Dear Sir/Madam, I hope you\u2019re doing well. I\u2019m Vicky Kumar , a student from the Data Science and Applications program at IIT Madras . Over the last few months, I\u2019ve built a personal project called \u201cVicky App\u201d \u2014 a smart assistant platform specifically designed to help students in courses like TDS, . The system is capable of: Accurately solving over 90% of assignment-style questions using regex and phonetic matching Dynamically executing the right code logic based on the student\u2019s input Processing uploaded files such as Excel, PDF, CSV, and JSON Delivering instant answers, completely independent of ChatGPT or any external LLM You can test the platform here: https://app.algsoch.tech What\u2019s in it for students: They type their question, and the backend executes the correct solution automatically Especially helpful for GA preparation, understanding problem logic, and reducing repetitive workload I\u2019ve made it free for the first 3 questions After that, students can access the full platform for just \u20b9199/month , which helps me cover system maintenance and hosting costs My Humble Request: This is a tool I\u2019ve built with immense effort and love for this course, and I genuinely believe it can benefit many students. To sustain the platform \u2014 hosting, APIs, file management, and backend orchestration \u2014 I\u2019ve introduced a small paid model after a free trial. I would be extremely grateful if you could test it once and, if you find it helpful, consider sharing it with upcoming students or mentioning it in a Moodle announcement. It\u2019s built by an IIT Madras student, for IIT Madras students \u2014 with the sole goal of making their learning smoother, faster, and smarter. Thank you so much for your time and support.

I looked into your code and noticed that you are using sklearn (I think which is not required in this case). Just get embedding vector for each document content and query by passing a valid POST request to http://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1/embeddings with required headers. And, then calculate similarity_scores simply using \\cos(\\theta) = \\frac{\\mathbf{A} \\cdot \\mathbf{B}}{|\\mathbf{A}| |\\mathbf{B}|} which in python syntax is- np.dot(vec1, vec2) / (np.linalg.norm(vec1) * np.linalg.norm(vec2))", "Title: GA3 - Large Language Models - Discussion Thread [TDS Jan 2025]\nQuestion: Please post any questions related to Graded Assignment 3 - Large Language Models .

I tried to use the OpenAI API, but I am getting the error as \u201cThe Maximum Quota has reached\u201d. I tried using 5 new API Keys from OpenAI, from 5 different accounts. So, I had to use SentenceTransformers, Alibaba gte model. So, as the model has changed, I think so it is expecting answer as got from OpenAI Model, but as I used Alibaba gte model, I am getting different result. Can you please explain how to solve this issue? This will be helpful in my future codes.

I am writing to highlight several issues and doubts related to different aspects of the course that require clarification and resolution. 1. Graded Assignments (GA) GA6 Doubts Unresolved: While doubts related to Q1 and Q2 have been \nAnswer: lakshaygarg654: GA Platform Changes: Initially, we were solving questions on exam.sanand.workers.dev . However, in GA6, we moved to Seek and in GA7, to Google Forms . The issue is that in GA6, we cannot check our answers like we could in previous assignments. The course is in transition. Initially all of it used to be on seek portal. But there were limitations of seek portal that we were not able to work around to deliver the kind of interactive, reactive and rapid corrections/iterations that are now possible because we moved the evaluations from the seek portal to the TDS server. Since the move to the new TDS server on the back end, we are able to also directly see students actual parameterised questions whenever doubts are raised. This is NOT possible on seek portal for us. The results are immediate to see. You got timely rapid feedback for GA 1 to GA 5 from the TAs. The TAs were also able to iterate quickly in discussion with the instructors and the professor as well as operations. With GA 6 our inability to actually see your individual question sets immediately (its possible, but it has to take a very circuitous route via 3 set of people) meant we were always on the back foot for both, checking the answers, as well as making any corrections. And since the questions were parameterised, for technical reasons it was extremely cumbersome/risky/impossible to make changes without it being VERY disruptive to all students. These were some of the reasons we are transitioning. We have seen this problem term after term in prior terms with regards to the seek portal. This is a technological limitation of the current seek portal that directly impacts our ability to react to a dynamic course like TDS. GA 7 was decided to submit via forms again for the reasons listed above. GA6 was straightforward because it was a traditional evaluation. Whereas GA7 is once again very unique and does not handle well in being configured in Seek Portal. Since it was not possible in such a short time to transition GA7 to our preferred hosting server and student favourite, we opted for the least disruptive solution that we are able to action very quickly upon. lakshaygarg654: Project 1: The result is still awaited, although it was expected on or before March 16. Any update on this would be helpful. Project 1 evaluations is VERY computationally intensive for us to evaluate. Each project although dockerised, with an average submission weighing at 2GB, we have to provision space of 1 TB along with the cloud computer resources for all of that (RAM and vCPUs) and if you thought creating project 1 was tough, you can imagine the technical challenge involved in evaluating the 600+ submissions with all the errors and issues we have to fix. In truth its all hands on deck for us here on the back end because it has been deemed critical. So while we are moving the course along, we are also aware that evaluations are at serious risk of missing crucial deadlines. We are taking the matter with utmost seriousness. Its just that we cant always keep you up to date on every set back we are facing. Each and everyone of us are concerned about Project 1 and are working on it. Anand, JK, Prasanna, myself, Jivraj and Saransh. We all have been given access to the eval server which we only managed to provision a few days ago and we are all trying to get the most ambitious TDS project evaluation out the dry dock and into the water and hoping it floats gracefully rather than sink in the estuary. Meanwhile we are busy patching the pipes in the belly of the ship while its rolling down the slipway. lakshaygarg654: 3. ROE Score Update While ROE scores may not be a primary concern, the bonus marks in ROE have still not been updated on the student dashboard. It would be helpful to get confirmation on when these will be reflected. You got the maximum possible mark in ROE. Does it not show you got 100 in ROE in the dashboard? I have been told by operations that it has been pushed.

However, despite these efforts\nAnswer: Hi @s.anand @jkmadathil @Bharathi @carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini Could you please look into the above issue? Additionally, I\u2019d like to highlight a concern regarding the current grading pattern ( JAN 2025 Term ) and overall course structuring: Grading Concerns Final Course Score: T = 0.15GAA + 0.2 ROE1 + 0.2 P1 + 0.2 P2 + 0.25 F (The weightage of Projects + ROE accounts for 60% of the total score.) From the following Discourse post, it appears that the ROE exam is extremely difficult to the point of being considered \u201cimpossible\u201d by students: What\u2019s the actual purpose of impossible ROE exam? . Given this, many students may directly lose 20 marks due to ROE, significantly impacting their overall scores. Furthermore, for Project 1 ( deadline: 16th Feb 2025 ), guidance was provided only in the week of the deadline. This was highly inconvenient, as the live session did not effectively address all student concerns. As a result, many students are at risk of losing a valuable 20 marks for Project 1. Course Structuring & Scheduling Issues Many students pursuing this course are dual-degree students or working professionals , making it challenging to keep up with live sessions and deadlines. The last-minute guidance for projects adds unnecessary pressure, especially for those juggling work or other academic commitments. The structuring and scheduling of sessions feel inappropriate, with crucial guidance sessions being held too late, making it difficult to implement feedback or clarify doubts in time. Request for Improvement To ensure a smoother learning experience, I request: Early guidance and detailed instructions for Project 2 , well in advance of the deadline. More structured and accessible support , considering the diverse student base, including working professionals. Better management of exam difficulty levels , ensuring that assessments are fair and reflect actual learning rather than being unnecessarily tough. I hope these concerns can be taken into account, and necessary improvements can be made.

However, despite these efforts\nAnswer: Thank you @A_LAKSHMI for the detailed post. This is much appreciated. Thought of quickly stepping in before Anand or other members from the course team gives a more detailed response. Let me be Open and Blunt to all in saying that the grading pattern will not be changed .  And the points below are some of quick things that came to my mind while reading the detailed listing of the challenges that have been put in the OP. TDS team have been tinkering with the course structure for the past 3 terms. You can check this Discourse thread where students have unanimously said that this is not an easy subject. In fact the first page of the TDS course GA1 itself should have given everyone an indication of what lies ahead. Anand has explicitly written down the below words: This course is quite hard Here\u2019s students\u2019 feedback: It used to be an easy course until 2024. # # # Now it\u2019s hard and covers more. Take it in your last semester if possible. # # # Plan extra time. It takes more time than typical 3-credit courses. # # # LLMs grade you \u2013 unpredictably. # # The ROE is hard. # Take Graded assignment 1 to check if you\u2019re ready for this course. Please drop this course (do it in a later term) if you score low. It\u2019ll be too tough for you now. TDS (or for that matter any course in this Degree program) is not supposed to be a single person effort. You should be realizing this even in your real life. A significant part of our learning process is social by nature. The only difference in this course is that we we explicitly encourage you to collaborate. If there is one main life lesson that we want you to learn out of this course then it is just this - Surviving tough situations require support all around us, and there is no shame in asking for help Again to quote Anand: We encourage learning by sharing You CAN copy from friends. You can work in groups. You can share code. Even in projects, assignments, and exams (except the final end-term exam). Why should you copy? Because in real life, there\u2019s no time to re-invent the wheel. You\u2019ll be working in teams on the shoulders of giants. It\u2019s important to learn how to do that well. To learn well, understand what you\u2019re copying. If you\u2019re short of time, prioritize. To learn better, teach what you\u2019ve learnt. Now will be a good point to reflect on the optimization problem of Grades versus Learning. The larger question for each of you is to consider the short-term advantage of better grades versus the long term advantage of improving the fundamentals related to tools usage (not just for Data Science, but in every day life itself). Once again Anand has a nice blog where [I think] he is trying to explain that neither do we know nor do students realize what is going to ultimately benefit us. This is a journey that all of us are taking together, and we hope such open interactions along with the course will make the learning (or teaching) experience enjoyable  and internally make us more humble. Whether you like it or not, life is becoming more complex day by day. And unless you figure out your optimization strategy, it is going to be a bumpy ride. And this is true even for the TDS course team members. Each of us are also juggling multiple responsibilities (some even doing 4 projects in this term) while ensuring that needed support can be provided to the learners. This is not lighten the issues that any of you have highlighted here, but just to point out that there is no flowery path for anyone here. Then the major question will be, why are all of doing this crazy business of learning tools in this way. The simplest answer is - Tools are evolving day by day, and unless we realize that they are just \u201ctools\u201d, it is going to consume us an eternity to master them The point of all the exercises and assessments, is for you to understand the fundamental aspects related to a tool and figure out your own strategies for getting a grip on them. @22f2001640 Management of time and difficulty levels are a shared responsibility. All of you have been sufficiently warned that the learning process wont be easy. In fact we have released all major content well in advance, so that learners can benefit from early access. And from our side, we also have realized the supporting learners wouldn\u2019t be easy. But I see that the TDS course team members have been putting their heart and soul in this course (and support), and even in this week they have prepared 3 sets of ROEs in order to ensure that all of you get enough practice opportunity.", "Title: Concerns Regarding TDS Course Difficulty and Grading Fairness\nQuestion: Thank you @A_LAKSHMI for the detailed post.

I want to invest myself in the ROE and the remaining project, but at this point I\u2019m so frustrated about getting at least 40 that rather than a valuable learning experience, this course seems like a burden to me.

So if you want to really check ROE readiness, fix the timer alarm for 45 mins and attempt it genuinely within the 45 mins. Only then will you know where you stand. Additionally, each ROE is completely different from the next. If you manage to do good in one is ZERO guarantee that you will do good in the next. Thats why do all 4 mock ROEs.

GA2 - Q6 has no dependency on the OS or your computer. It uses Github (an online platform), it uses Vercel (an online platform) and thats it. I have a macbook air and it works fine for GA2 - Q6. Since the code you are running has no such dependency on your local machine it should not have problems. Now typical problems for example Q6 (and other questions) might involve the use of CORS. So for example the url might work in your browser when you access the vercel deployment url directly, but when using it via the GA, the request triggers a CORS error, because a third party application is requesting rather than you directly. Also the live sessions on youtube will address some of these deployment related issues that students are facing.

You are not expected to setup and run a local http server as you are doing in your code. When a call is made to the endpoint which in this scenario is /api with parameters, only one function is required, i.e the function that handles the get request. The rest is also automagically handled by vercel. There might be a conflict between vercel\u2019s webserver deployment and the one you explicitly have encoded in your program. That\u2019s why if you see in the course content about vercel, the simplest API service that you can launch with vercel looks something like this # api/index.py\nimport json\nfrom http.server import BaseHTTPRequestHandler\n\nclass handler(BaseHTTPRequestHandler):\n    def do_GET(self):\n        self.send_response(200)\n        self.send_header('Content-type','application/json')\n        self.send_header(\"Access-Control-Allow-Origin\", \"*\")\n        self.end_headers()\n        self.wfile.write(json.dumps({\"message\": \"Hello!\"}).encode('utf-8'))\n        return Notice there is no if __name__ == \"__main__\": code block. This would instruct the interpreter that this is the starting point of your module. Clearly we do not want that, we want vercel to handle all the backend server stuff because vercel might be running some preflight code before it runs your application. if __name__ == \"__main__\": is used to execute some code only if the file was run directly, and not imported. In vercel, it might not be the starting point of the application. Try rewriting it with just the required endpoint function inside the default handler class. Avoid custom named classes until you can get a working prototype working using the boilerplate that has been shared. Another possible problem: By default, the JSON module encodes Unicode objects (such as str and Unicode) into the \\u escape sequence when generating JSON data. The GA however is expecting a serialised  UTF-8 JSON response instead. These might look the same on the screen but are not equivalent at the bytecode level. These encoding problems were covered in one of the videos that talked about encoding issues TDS > Development Tools > unicode So converting your output to UTF-8 might fix it. Let us know what worked. We are all learning from each other.

Thats what TDS is about. Solutions. How you achieved is not very relevant. There is more than one way to skin a cat. That being said, it good to find multiple ways to solve a problem, because a single method may not work everytime. Like for example in an ROE. You have no time and you got to be able to on the fly try different approaches, if one way does not work. Also purely from the point of view of being a \u201cscientist\u201d, its fun to be able to solve the question of how do you get a locally running server available on the web to a client. So in that sense, I understand the \u201cspirit of your question\u201d. Most of the issues that most people face has to do with limited understanding of how applications and networks communicate. These are first and foremost apps that leverage various aspects of network communication. There are entire courses that deal with that subject, we want you to at least understand the basics. In that regard we have not actually provided you sufficient materials to get to grips with that. It is something we ought to address, but then students complain about having to learn too many things. Yet these are basic essentials! So we are trying to get the balance right. For the most part many just muddle their way through it (like most of us I suspect), but some structured understanding of how these communications happen are probably worth their weight in gold for any aspiring data scientist because you then do not have to get IT nannies to deploy something quickly and you will wow your bosses as the guy/gal who just gets it done. In the meanwhile: There are other great videos on the above channel, but these are probably the most relevant for us. Modern applications also leverage the same concept by using ports to talk to each other and provide services. These then have to be made visible to the outside world using some routing tables, but there are software that does this automagically. But sometimes when things break, understanding why its not working will go a long way towards helping you find the solution. And a fix might be as simple as an entry on a firewall or on a routing table (a one line CLI fix). And everyone thinks you are a genius, when in actual fact you just know a little bit more about the underlying architecture that glues everything.

I have to redo the entire process for it to be correct again. Can you clarify why this is happening?\nAnswer: because it dynamically checks the answer each time a submit is done and if the ngrok tunnel and the service is not running at the time, then it marks it wrong. Since every student\u2019s answer is going to be unique (unlike a mathematics question), by necessity we have to dynamically check the answer each submit. The workaround to prevent having to do it all over again, is to simply check all your answers that do not need active running servers first, then before doing a final save, run the servers for the required questions and the ngrok tunnel and submit to get the full marks. Just dont forget that your last save is what gets graded. Just ignore for now once you got it working.

Its serverless! Instead you create functions that respond to endpoints. When the endpoint is triggered, the appropriate function runs. This renders name == main part of the code unnecessary at best, since python interpreters only run this line if that file was the starting point of the application (but its not, because a vercel wrapper application(s) or processes have started before it). In other words you do not create a flask server, or a http server or indeed any server at all. Just functions tied to specific endpoints. So you have to rethink how your application is designed. You do not create serverless applications in the same traditional way you have been taught in MAD-1 or MAD-2. This is a common mistake many students have been making with their approach to vercel. Watching the videos and using the provided code template will greatly help in deploying successful serverless applications. Thanks for your input.

Thanks in advance.", "Title: Project 2 and Week 6 assignment\nQuestion: @carlton If possible, could you inform what weeks the project 2 would be based on (like Project 1 was based on week 3 content). Thanks in advance.\nAnswer: Project 1 was based on Module 1 through 3. Project 2 will encompass Module 4 through 6 (and possibly 7) but not to the exclusion of the prior modules. These are not set in stone and still is in the design/validation phase. We generally avoid calling it week 3 content etc. because all the content was released as modules at the beginning well before the term was started. The GAs are released as we complete validations on them. Each term the course assignments are updated to stay current with industry expectations. So they are not recycled like subjects that are static like maths, statistics and programming which have syllabi that have not changed in 10 years or more. We try to release GAs so that they match the cadence of the other subjects for the convenience of students wherever possible. But rarely do other subjects require constant revalidation for their GAs. Hence we have situations, even in past terms, where GAs and Projects get moved to allow for robust validations of the answers. In spite of this some errors do slip through due to the aggressive time schedule in a trimester system as opposed to a semester system. Hope that give you some insight into how TDS works.

A GA question usually tests one concept in isolation. ROEs typically require you to combine multiple concepts and use multiple tools in order to answer the question. (in a very short time). If your goal is totally rely on the LLM to solve it for you\u2026 past experience shows us that ROEs complexity is usually difficult for an LLM to overcome without significant assistance from the \u201chooomann\u201d So practise with the concepts are going to be key without having to look up everything because looking up everything takes too much time. Collaboration with others is going be helpful. ROE is not proctored and is open internet. There is a reason for that. Its very hard. There will be a dataset or multiple datasets. Sometimes you may have to combine datasets to answer questions. You will have to extract data from the dataset. You will have to transform/clean the data and you will have to gain some information from the data, is what typical ROEs test.

Also 45 mins is not a given, its a typical time we aim for. It can be shorter or longer depending on the nature of the questions in the ROE. Each one is unique.

The keys to a successful Project 1 are: Deliverables, and an example of the Evaluation has been provided. If your project runs in accordance with the Evaluation methodology then it is considered. Screenshot 2025-01-27 at 8.35.23 am 1764\u00d71764 374 KB Please read the documentation carefully from top to bottom. So the main question is how do you test if the script will run according to the evaluation? The whole point is for it to run not just on your system. It should be deployable anywhere on any machine. Your solution should work anywhere we test it. Thats why you package it in a docker container. How you achieve that is up to you. But if we cannot run your docker container according to the specification we have provided then it has failed this crucial test.

If that was the case then there is no use for an LLM. Your application should be able to take parse the input and be able to run commands that do similar things in parameterised fashion.

Please use this for local llm to verify output Also Ollama doesn\u2019t require Schemas CHECK OUT THE REPO AND ANY INPUTS ARE WELCOME Link to ReadMe and also repo\nAnswer: Hi Andrew, You have done a great job with the Phase A tasks. Very methodical, well structured, logical and even incorporates (unnecessarily) two different ways of evaluating its performance via local llm or the project proxy. I just want to forewarn you (and others who are tempted to just blindly copy and paste) that evaluate.py is not meant to give you an exact expectation of what prompts will be sent to your application. In other words getting 10/10 in evaluate.py does NOT guarantee 10/10 or even 5/10  or 1/10 in the real evaluation. So do not write your code so rigidly that it will only work in the very strict interpretation of evaluate.py . It has always been meant to give you a feel for what to aim for. Your code should be flexible enough to deal with the general idea of the task. That said, evaluate.py is a good way to know what to expect. Some of Phase A tasks although given a detailed specification in the project description, will still be given challenging prompts (i.e. hard difficulty, and requires some clever self correcting mechanism). Some of the tasks will be given straight forward prompt (i.e. easy for your application).  Some of the tasks will be given with some level of parameterisation that deviates from the strict interpretation (i.e. medium difficulty). Hope that helps with how you deal with Phase B tasks (and making your Phase A more robust to a stronger evaluation.) A word of caution: (i.e. this is just some advice, not a set in stone recommendation) Your requirements.txt is massive. If your code does not execute a task ( possibly your first task ) within 20 seconds (on our server) then it will fail that task. You might want to consider a dynamic, flexible way of installing only required libraries when necessary and keeping the image footprint small and efficient, as we will necessarily have limits on how big we allow images to grow since we have to run and evaluate hundreds of images automatically.

It usually happens due to manual intervention with pip3 the user might break some system dependencies which require some python3 package. No need to worry about it. Another Fix: try using a virtual environment which is highly suggested since there is no chance for you to interfere with the system packages. create a venv using python3 -m venv name_of_venv add this line to your .bashrc in ~ folder as source /path/to/your/venv/location and run source .bashrc. This time no error occurs as you do everything in your virtual environment you can install anything python3 package using pip3 install package name.

Every time I send a POST request to: bash Copy https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1/embeddings I receive a 401 Unauthorized response. This, in turn, causes my code to fail with a KeyError: 'data' because the expected JSON response doesn\u2019t include the \"data\" key. What I\u2019ve Tried Token Verification: I\u2019m using the AIPROXY_TOKEN obtained by logging in at aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev with my IITM email. The token is passed in the header as follows: python Copy \"Authorization\": f\"Bearer {AIPROXY_TOKEN}\" I added debug prints to confirm that the token is being used correctly (printing the first few characters). API Request Details: The request includes the correct Content-Type: application/json header. The payload is set as: json Copy {\"model\": \"text-embedding-3-small\", \"input\": [\"Test\"]} Despite this, the response status is consistently 401 Unauthorized. Debug Output: Here\u2019s a snippet of the debug output: bash Copy HTTP Request: POST https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1/embeddings \"HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized\"\n\ud83d\udd34 A9 failed: 'data' This confirms that the issue is with the authentication rather than our processing logic. What I Suspect The token may be invalid, expired, or misconfigured. There could be changes in the token permissions or endpoint requirements that I\u2019m not aware of. Alternatively, there might be an issue on the server side with token validation. Request for Help Has anyone else encountered this issue recently? Could someone verify if there are any changes to the authentication requirements for the embeddings endpoint? Any insights or updated instructions on how to ensure the token is valid and has the proper permissions would be greatly appreciated.

To test that my application would run everywhere, I first deleted all images from my local machine using podman rmi -a and then ran podman run --rm -p 8000:8000 -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN $IMAGE_NAME with the appropriate variables set. This is as per the instructions provided here . But this gave me the following error: Error: short-name \"freshbash/dataworks-agent\" did not resolve to an alias and no unqualified-search registries are defined in \"/etc/containers/registries.conf The above is the format in which we have to provide the image name in the Google form. So, I was confused whether this would succeed during actual evaluation. The only way its working right now is when I specify the image name to be docker.io/freshbash/dataworks-agent I\u2019m not yet very good with how containers work so some insights would be very helpful.

This excludes any week 2 and week 3 content which also would have given you the necessary skills to do Project 1. The sessions on YouTube give you a start to finish overview of how to approach it. All of your concerns were duly noted and mentioned. Considering all the above, including the concerns mentioned by students: Project 1 deadline will NOT be changed. Please make sure to carefully read the Deliverables and the Evaluation section and do them carefully and watch the intro to Week 3 - Session 1 to get an overview of what is absolutely essential and required.

(Some have Gate exam on Saturday also). So, extending the timeline to at least Sunday, 16th Feb would be truly appreciated. Week 3 release date timeline is 24 Jan, we need adequate time to go through the weekly materials. All the contents are already released, so by the same logic upcoming Project 2 contents are also available but that doesn\u2019t mean that we can complete the upcoming project within a week. Project help sessions came on 11th February(live) and 12th Feb on YouTube, just 4 days before the submission date, though I am not complaining about this and genuinely appreciating the team\u2019s effort, but this does gives very less time for many of us here.

Instead of extending the deadline, I propose adjusting the weightage, allocating 15% to Project 1 and 25% to Project 2. This adjustment seems fair, as Project 2 requires students to build upon the concepts used in Project 1.

The Emergency Management Center is located at a central command post, and must plan the most efficient evacuation route to ensure rapid and safe community evacuation. The four communities are: Silver Springs Community : (42.1029,-85.665) ;Pleasant Harbor Community : (42.1238,-85.9043);Summit Shores Village : (42.0415,-85.8696);River Retreat Outpost : (42.0417,-85.6836) & Central Command Post Location: (42.0587,-85.7226) Using the Haversine package, calculate the distance from the Central Command Post to Silver Springs Community. Which of the following is the MOST ACCURATE distance 10418 meters 12287 meters 10965 meters 11149 meters Whose right answer turned out 6873, however the answer pushed is 12287 meters, which is nowhere near the closest options (it would\u2019ve been correct if the destination was summit shores village which isn\u2019t the case with this question) Also, my question 4 was : As an investment analyst monitoring motorcycle resale values, develop a forecasting model to predict future resale prices by brand and segment, considering seasonality and long-term trends. Specifically, forecast the 2027 resale value of the Kawasaki - Ninja 300 in Tamil Nadu, using historical data. 134483 94774 150666 199711 Whose correct option (through different methods and algorithms) was approximately closest to 94774 and again answer pushed is 150666 which again turns out to be incorrect So is the case with questions 1 and 2 (where answers aren\u2019t pushed according to absolute values, but as conveyed earlier, I believe this shall be resolved) Kindly look into it Thanks and Regards", "Title: Graded assignment 6\nQuestion: Please post any questions related to Graded Assignment 6 - Data Analysis Please use markdown code formatting (fenced code blocks) when sharing code (rather than screenshots).

I understand that in a professional setting, we often work on multiple projects simultaneously, and developing the habit of us\nAnswer: Yes, using a virtual environment is definitely considered best practice when working on Python projects. This approach helps avoid dependency conflicts between projects and ensures a consistent development environment. The main reasons why you should use virtual environments: Isolation \u2013 Each project has its own set of dependencies, preventing conflicts with other projects. Reproducibility \u2013 A virtual environment ensures that all contributors work with the same dependencies. Portability \u2013 You can share a project with others (or deploy it) without worrying about system-wide package versions interfering. Installing with pip individually (pip install package-name) \u2022 Good for quick experimentation and testing. \u2022 Not ideal for long-term project management because dependencies might update and break compatibility over time. Using requirements.txt \u2022 Best for reproducibility and collaboration since others can install the exact same dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt. \u2022 Avoids issues where one developer uses an updated library that breaks compatibility with another developer\u2019s setup. Specifying Versions in requirements.txt \u2022 If you don\u2019t specify a version , pip install -r requirements.txt will install the latest available versions, which might introduce unexpected breaking changes. \u2022 If you do specify a version (package==1.2.3) , you ensure consistency but may run into problems if that version becomes unavailable or has compatibility issues. Handling Version Conflicts \u2022 If a package version fails to install, try removing the strict version constraint and reinstall. \u2022 Instead of completely omitting version numbers, consider: \u2022 Using greater than/less than constraints : package>=1.2,<2.0 (allows updates but avoids major version changes). \u2022 Running pip freeze > requirements.txt after confirming a stable environment. Best Practices Summary Always use a virtual environment (e.g., venv or conda). Use a requirements.txt file for reproducibility. Pin versions cautiously\u2014avoid unnecessary strict versioning unless needed. Periodically review and update dependencies to prevent using outdated or insecure packages. Kind regards", "Title: Best Practices for Virtual Environments and Dependency Management in Python\nQuestion: Is it considered best practice to create a virtual environment rather than installing packages globally, especially when working on projects that require multiple libraries? I understand that in a professional setting, we often work on multiple projects simultaneously, and developing the habit of us\nAnswer: For some projects where there are many dependencies, like an ML project or flask app, it\u2019s better you mantain a virtual environment since the dependencies are interconnected with their versions. Whereas for some simple projects, with less dependencies, global installation is fine. For project that is to be deployed, make sure you use the virtual environment, only then you can ensure what worked for you also works on the deployement 24f2006531: Additionally, when managing dependencies, would it be better to install packages individually using pip or list them in a requirements.txt file? Coming to your second question, The first time you install a fresh dependency, use direct and latest version. But if you are cloning or thinking of sharing the repo or using someone\u2019s project it\u2019s better to use requirements.txt. 24f2006531: My understanding is that if a version is not specified in the requirements.txt file, it installs the latest available version, whereas specifying a version ensures a specific installation The creation of requirements.txt ensures that the current installation version is listed. Never try to list requirements.txt. There is a command to do that, pip3 freeze > requirements.txt .

Query construction is best done by thinking what you want at the end. In this case its an ordered post_id So thats where you begin: SELECT post_id\nFROM (\n...\n)\nORDER BY post_id Doing this, produces the actual result without giving the logic yet. Then at each stage you add the next stage of complexity. You will still need the post_id for the outermost layer so you have to continue extracting it from the inner layers of the nested query. ...\n...\nFROM (\n   SELECT post_id, ( ... ) as max_stars\n   FROM social_media\n   WHERE time_stamp >= (whatever the parameter you have been given)\n      AND max_stars >= (whatever the parameter for min stars you have been given)\n)\n...\n... Then the final layer of the nest ...\n...\n(\n\n) as max_stars\n...\n... You are not expecting me to solve the whole question right? (Hint: the inner most extraction involves JSON or \u201cstructure\u201d extraction, which is a powerful capability) But I hope you understand the logic of SQL which is a very elegant set theory language which is why it has lasted for over 4 decades. Think clearly at each stage what do you need. Start with the answer and work backwards, extracting at each stage the logical items you require for the outer layer to be functional.

Deadline: 2025-02-15T18:30:00Z @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini @carlton\nAnswer: QUESTION 9 I was supposed to transcribe the audio of the provided video for a certain time period. After several attempts my submission still generated differences from the supposed answers. I have tried all forms of re-punctuations but the error wont budge. I even compared the generated transcript with the actual audio several times. I BELIEVE MY ANSWER IS CORRECT. If not I wish to know what the correct answer is. Because compared to the video I have provided the exact and well punctuated transcription of the audio between 397.2 and 505.5 seconds. Here was my transcription - \" Determined to confront the mystery, Miranda followed the elusive figure. In the dim corridor, fleeting glimpses of determination and hidden sorrow emerged, challenging her assumptions of friends and foes alike. The pursuit led her to a narrow, winding passage beneath the chapel. In the oppressive darkness, the air grew cold and heavy, and every echo of her footsteps seemed to whisper warnings of secrets best left undisturbed. In a subterranean chamber, the shadow finally halted. The figure\u2019s voice emerged from the gloom, \u201cYou are close to the truth, but be warned some secrets, once uncovered, can never be buried again.\u201d The mysterious stranger introduced himself as Victor, a former confidant of Edmund. His words painted a tale of coercion and betrayal\u2014a network of hidden alliances that had forced Edmond into an impossible choice. Victor detailed clandestine meetings, cryptic codes, and a secret society that manipulated fate from behind the scenes. Miranda listened, each revelation tightening the knots of suspicion around her mind. From within his warm coat, Victor produced a faded journal brimming with names, dates, and enigmatic symbols. Its contents mirrored Edmund\u2019s diary, strengthening the case for a conspiracy rooted in treachery. The journal hinted at a hidden hall beneath the manor, where the secret society stored evidence of their manipulations. Miranda\u2019s pulse quickened at the thought of unmasking those responsible for decades of deceit. Returning to the manor\u2019s main hall, Miranda retraced her steps with renewed resolve. Every shadow in the corridor now seemed charged with meaning, each creak of wood a prelude to further revelations. In the manor\u2019s basement, beneath a concealed panel, Miranda discovered another revelation \"", "Title: GA5 - Data Preparation - Discussion Thread [TDS Jan 2025]\nQuestion: Please post any questions related to Graded Assignment 5 - Data Preparation .

Due to a technical issue in the portal, both options 1 and 4 are correct answers. The final scoring has been adjusted accordingly, and full marks will be awarded for either response. HTTP method is id\nAnswer: Thank you for the clarification provided regarding Question 4 and resolution of errors in other questions. I understand the reasoning behind choosing Option A (Time, Request, Method, URL). However, I respectfully believe Option C (Time, Method, URL, Referer) is more accurate for the following reasons: Redundancy in Option A: The Request field already contains the HTTP method, URL, and protocol (e.g., \u201cPOST /images/logo.png HTTP/1.1\u201d). Including both Request and separate Method and URL fields introduces redundancy. If we already extract Method and URL separately for filtering, the full Request field becomes unnecessary. Simplicity in Filtering: Filtering for \u201cPOST requests under /images/\u201d from 15:00 to 18:00 on Mondays can be done using: Time \u2192 for checking the hour and weekday. Method \u2192 to filter only POST. URL \u2192 to ensure the request is under /images/. Thus, Option C (Time, Method, URL, Referer) already includes all needed fields. While Referer is not essential, it doesn\u2019t interfere with the filtering and might be useful in future extended filtering cases (e.g., source tracking). Therefore, Option C is complete and accurate without being redundant. Consistency with Log Parsing Practices: In most log analysis scripts or systems (e.g., Python\u2019s re or pandas parsing of logs), Method and URL are parsed from Request for separate use. This further supports the idea that including Request alongside Method and URL is not best practice.", "Title: Queries regarding End Term exam solutions\nQuestion: Clarifications on Queries Which of the following is a valid log entry based on the provided format?

If it classified an image as arm then we ran it on arm. If it did not then we ran it on x86. Thats why we need students to look through the logs and identify issues so that we can make sure you get the correct evaluation. If students notify us their image is actually arm based, then we will run it on arm. So dont worry, just inform us of any discrepancy as well as bugs. Our evaluation might not be perfect, there may be bugs. If students can precisely create bug reports then we can take that into consideration when evaluating students as well. The benefit being you might get extra marks because of the bug fix. We have a script that looks at this discourse post each day and tells us who requires a fresh evaluation.

Running on your local machine is not a sufficient criteria for passing the evaluation. It is absolutely vital for students to understand deployment. This is a critical skill for anyone who is serious about working in this field. Also just check if yours is an arm based image or x86. Sometimes that makes a difference. For us there is no way to know other than docker software telling us. As it turns out several students had an arm based image but docker did not tell us that. So we will re run those.

Also, kindly pardon me for the long message. I have received a MISSING statement in my evaluation log file in the project 1 score mail that was released yesterday. These are the detailed point wise concerns : I at the earlier stages, found the Tools in Data Science course relatively challenging as it\u2019s just my second term in Diploma and I have only completed BDM and MLF Course till now. Hence, I decided to drop the course in February, however when I could still view the course on the portal, and raised concerns, the assistance provided to me was very grim and low, and after numerous follow-ups, I was finally informed 2\u00bd weeks after dropping my course, that my drop application was received in draft and they would not proceed with it, and I had to continue my course. By this time, I had already missed 2 graded assignment deadlines and the project 1 submission was due in the coming 2 days. Not losing my spirit and with whatever I could learn and implement I completed the TDS project 1. However, I accidentally attached the wrong docker image link, and I also raised the issue, but didn\u2019t receive a reply. I understand that it was a fault on my part, but evaluating a student as 0, even though all their functions are right, and they give the required answers, is also wrong since we are expected to provide correct answers, and learn to build the docker image, however, there can be occurrences where a student might make a small mistake like uploading the wrong link, and they must be given a small chance to reprimand them. I also didn\u2019t receive the mail from the TDS Team which they issued for students whose docker image or GitHub link was erroneous, and hence I realised after the deadline that I had uploaded the wrong docker image link. I have rechecked all my function, and they are all correct, giving a 0 to a student, who worked hard within the limited available time(given the student had dropped the course but the course team didn\u2019t process it) is very unfair. Kindly provide me a way to either re-upload my project-1 Docker image link, or ask them to provide me marks on the basis of the functions and codes written, whichever is feasible, atleast to encourage the efforts and time put into the project with little knowledge. I hope you would look into my plight, and take necessary measures.

However, there are specific cases like mine where the Project 1 submission successfully passed the sanity checks on Feb 15 and received a decent score when the evaluation results were released on Mar 29. image 1272\u00d7395 25.7 KB But here\u2019s the catch:** Since the problem statement for Project 1 and Project 2 is nearly the same, I took the opportunity to improve upon my Project 1 and use it as the foundation for my Project 2 submission, which I did by:* Implementing a ReAct-based workflow planning & orchestration agent, inspired by the paper ReAct: Synergizing Reasoning and Acting in Language Models . Implementing various tools for web-serping, web-scraping, read-eval-print-loops interpreters for quick calculations, etc. Enhancing Shell-use & Python-use by improving upon the existing code interpreter I had implemented for P1. This allowed the agent to dynamically generate and execute code without hardcoding anything. Adding useful API endpoints, including an /api/ multipart/form endpoint, alongside the existing /read and /run endpoints from Project 1, plus a /clear endpoint to reset the agent\u2019s conversation memory if the context window gets saturated. Deploying the entire project on a paid GCP VM Instance with a static IP , utilizing my own OpenAI API key while keeping OpenAI\u2019s API as a fallback in case AIPROXY ever gave up. All this hard work evolved my project into something far beyond a simple Tool-Calling Agent\u2014it essentially became a ReAct Principles based Computer-Using Agent capable of executing complex, non-linear workflows entirely within a container. And I\u2019m not exaggerating: You could ask it to perform something like hyperparameter tuning for a Random Forest Classifier, offloading the results locally on a JSON file and displaying its contents , and it would do that for you\u2014without ever declining the request. I like to think of it as a terminal version of OpenAI\u2019s Computer-Using Agent . Given all the effort, time, and money that went into this, it\u2019s incredibly discouraging to see my project naturally fail a sanity check (Docker image digest mismatch) (because of the aforesaid updates) and not get evaluated as a result. This is not the kind of experience that encourages students to learn, experiment, and innovate. To clarify, all the updates mentioned above took place after March 29 , after Project 1 had already been evaluated, and results had been handed out. Furthermore, we were never informed that a reevaluation would take place on April 1. Had I known, I would have ensured that my original submission remained unchanged and considered creating a duplicate of my Docker image and implementing all the aforementioned enhancements on it. My only request is that if my updated P1 submission cannot be evaluated due to the changes made after March 29 (before the P1 reevaluation on April 1), I would really appreciate it if my original P1 eval score could be reinstated instead of receiving a 0 \u2014since it was already evaluated and graded.

It was also communicated via an email when students failed first prerequisite check pass back in February 16th. At that time we gave students a time window to fix it. We discussed it internally with @s.anand and he stated that it is standard industry practise to put Dockerfile in the root folder of a github and he expects students to do it regardless of whether we explicitly mentioned it or not on the project 1 page. The reason being, any Docker image being built from a github repo is never going to look for the file sitting inside a directory. All build requirements have to be at root (this is not just for Docker, but also any other type of application build). Since root is where the core files to build an application always reside, again this is standard industry practise. In our meeting we advocated for a lenient approach to search for Dockerfile inside the github and it was vetoed by @s.anand So unless you can give a convincing argument why we should change our evaluation script and re run it for everyone again, (because that is effectively what we would have to do to make it fair to everyone), we will not be able to evaluate your docker image.

However with regards to your long post\u2026 Let me tell you a true story. I personally know a very experienced senior engineer at a top defense contractor for the US, here is some pearls of wisdom from him. What you have done is what is called in industry as gold plating . Its a cardinal sin in software engineering. NEVER gold plate. ALWAYS build to spec. In fact its a good reason to fire an engineer. Why? Because it does not deliver what was required, Wastes valuable time and resources Increases technical debt (this is actually a huge cost over the expected lifetime of the project!) Complicates testing Leads to scope creep His advice to me was simple: NEVER gold plate. I hope you take this pearl of wisdom in your career. It will help you advance and make you stand out. For personal hobbies this does not apply. But for a client (including us) if you fail to deliver the minimum spec then we cannot grant you an evaluation (by the way this post is not targetted specifically for you, it just felt like an appropriate place to explain this).

However with regards to y\nAnswer: Thanks for the clarification regarding the evaluation, @carlton . It\u2019s a relief to know that my original submission was successfully evaluated. Had I known that the stricter evaluation script would pull the image matching the digest from the time of submission (which had been overwritten by April 1), I would\u2019ve used a separate tag to avoid the issue altogether. Regarding your point on gold plating \u2014 I completely understand and have come to appreciate the importance of building to spec from personal experience, especially in production or client-facing settings where fixed targets, maintainability, and minimal scope creep are key. That said, with TDS projects, my goal was purely exploratory \u2014 to explore the boundaries of what\u2019s possible within the scope of the problem statement . What began as just another (pun intended) tedious assignment slowly evolved into a hobbyist research project on LLM agents. (\u2026caution: long post ahead ) I noticed that test cases in Project 1 and 2 were highly specific and often overlapping on Python & Shell use . While it would\u2019ve been easy to hardcode 50+ Python functions to pass these cases (which, frankly, many of us were doing), it is non-scalable at best. I quickly realized that stochastic parrots + hardcoded functions were a recipe for disaster, especially considering the inherent randomness in LLM-generated payloads . No two payloads are exactly alike \u2014 even minor differences, like an absolute vs relative file path, or some hidden edge case could cause a hardcoded solution to fail unpredictably. There\u2019s also really no way to predict an edge case caused by an LLM. Some might suggest using temperature=0 to get more deterministic LLM behavior \u2014 and while true to an extent, it does little to encourage exploration, especially in tasks that require self-correction based on environmental feedback. Prompt engineering too wouldn\u2019t be helpful here as 4o-mini isn\u2019t all that great at 0-shot instruction following, especially when the system prompt is already saturated with 50+ fine-grained instructions. There\u2019s only so much stuff it can pay attention to. Hardcoded tool agents also aren\u2019t really \u201cagents\u201d in my view\u2014 they\u2019re more like passive AI powered regex matchers : merely mapping inputs to functions by inferring from context window. That puts all the burden of answering on the hardcoded functions, leaving the agent itself uninvolved in the solutioning process. If they break, the agent will never try to \u2018fix\u2019 them and keep calling them like a broken record. At the core of it, it\u2019s all about how much flexibility vs rigidity we give to the agent. Fully rigid solutions (e.g. hardcoding) overfit and break easily; fully flexible ones (e.g. pure LLM based) hallucinate or drift off-target. The sweet spot lies somewhere in between \u2014 The right solution would naturally balance the lesser of two evils in an ideal ratio. Since most LLMs already excel at code generation and structured solutioning, the most effective strategy that I figured out for the agent was to, Reason about the task, understand intent, Reflect, whether this problem is solvable using available tools without human intervention and design structured workflows, in whatever order appropriate (i.e. design a DAG, where each node can be a python step or a shell step or something else) Execute those workflows ( walk the DAG) observing the feedback at each step and reiterating if needed. Observe the final result, and repeat if needed. Interestingly, a similar framework was suggested in this ICLR 2022 paper . That was all the validation I needed to know I was stepping in the right direction. To make environment interaction possible, the agent didn\u2019t need dozens of narrow tools \u2014 just a small, well-defined set of general-purpose tools : A REPL executor (for quick calcs) A Python script runner A Shell executor With just these, it could handle most tasks flexibly and naturally \u2014 avoiding overengineering while still enabling powerful behaviors. Potentially allowing for full fledged Computer-Use via shell and so much more. As for the fact that it ended up being capable of things beyond the scope of Project 1 (like training & tuning ML models autonomously, reporting results etc.) \u2014 that was emergent behavior , not deliberate gold plating. It was a pleasant surprise even to me. I\u2019ve yet to discover more of such interesting hidden use cases. While some might naturally call it scope creeping (and yes that is true, given that we had a deadline, and a play-pretend client-business relationship with the course team), I saw it as an opportunity for exploration and research. Frankly, I AM personally very keen about researching stuff! I am actually very thankful to the TDS course team & @s.anand for devising such a thoughtful project that sparked some interesting ideas that I can tinker with. Food for thought! Really! As for my next project, I now have a fair idea of what I\u2019ll be experimenting with\u2014 modalities. PS: I\u2019m not claiming it\u2019s perfect or production-ready, or it should score a perfect 22/20, but it aligned well with what I believe was the spirit of these projects: thoughtful use of LLMs in agent design . At this point, I\u2019m less concerned about the marks, I\u2019m actually enjoying the thought joyride. TL;DR My approach doesn\u2019t rely on regex or hardcoded mappings. Instead, it passes user input directly to an LLM, which then plans and executes workflows using general tools inside a containerized environment. It also learns from feedback and iterates \u2014 much like a human. The fact that it can do more than just the minimum spec is a byproduct of that framework. I\u2019ve only just wired the pieces together. Kind regards", "Title: Tds-official-Project1-discrepencies\nQuestion: @carlton @Jivraj Sir can you also see the case of Dockerfile name.

Steps Taken to Replicate the Test Environment I cloned my repository using: bash\ngit clone <my_repo_url>\ncd <my_repo_directory>\nI built the Docker image using:\n\nbash\ndocker build -t.\nI ran the Docker container with:\n\nbash\ndocker run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000\n\nI ensured that datagen.py and evaluate.py were placed in the same folder as instructed.\n\nFinally, I ran the evaluation script using:\n\nbash\nuvicorn evaluate.py --email=<any_email> --token_counter 1 --external_port 8000 Issue with Original Submission After reviewing the evaluation logs, I identified that the issue with my original submission was caused by binary incompatibility between pandas (version 2.0.3) and NumPy (version 1.24.3). These versions worked perfectly during development on my local machine and were tested multiple times across both Linux and Windows platforms before submission. Even after pulling the submitted Docker image from Docker Hub post-submission, it worked without any issues locally. However, during your evaluation, this incompatibility caused the container to fail. I acknowledge this issue, have fixed it in my updated submission, and previously conveyed this in my earlier message. Action Taken To address this issue, I made a small adjustment to my requirements.txt file to explicitly fix these versions for compatibility across all environments. This was the only change made to my submission. After rebuilding the container with this updated file, I tested it again thoroughly in your replicated test environment, and it worked as expected: The application initializes correctly on port 8000 within 5 minutes. It responds to requests within the required timeframe. I have pushed this updated image to Docker Hub under the same repository: Docker Hub URL: santoshsharma003/tds-project-one-1:latest Request for Re-Evaluation I kindly request that you pull the latest version of my Docker image from Docker Hub and re-run the evaluation process. I understand that deployability is being tested, and I have taken every necessary step to ensure that my submission now works in any environment, including replicating your test setup exactly. Previous Message for Reference For your convenience, here is my earlier message explaining this issue in detail: \"Greetings, Sir, I would like to bring to your notice a problem with my original submission of the Docker container. During evaluation, a binary incompatibility between pandas and numpy caused the container to fail. To my surprise, the same versions (pandas==2.0.3 and numpy==1.24.3) were working fine while developing on my local machine. I also tested it with the same Dockerfile on both Linux and Windows platforms using these versions, and it was functioning correctly before pushing and submitting it. I checked the other day after pulling the Docker image from Docker Hub following the submission, and it worked at that time as well. To resolve this issue, I adjusted the Dockerfile to explicitly fix these versions, rebuilt the container, and conducted further testing locally. The application now correctly initializes on port 8000 and returns expected responses within the required 5-minute timeframe. I\u2019ve pushed the updated image to Docker Hub (santoshsharma003/tds-project-one-1:latest). Could you please ensure that the latest version of my image is pulled from Docker Hub before rerunning the evaluation? I appreciate your time and effort in reviewing my submission again.

We discussed all these scenarios in our weekly meets, and it was decided that we cannot make allowances for these because there was ample time to test your deployments and also ample sessions were conducted to address any difficulties you might have faced. A basic minimum standard was expected and we are unable to relax that threshold because then it would make evaluations meaningless. We are not just evaluating on your agent functions. We require deployability as a minimum target. If you solution was not deployable and functional then we cannot evaluate the functioning of your application. Once again I sympathise with what might seem minor errors. But they are not minor, even though it may only be a line that needs changing or a spelling mistake. They actually cause a critical failure. A minor mistake is a function not working that does not prevent other things from working. Critical failures prevents everything else from working and thus most of these what seems like minor failures are missclassified. They are in fact critical failures. I know its not of much comfort right now, but the learnings from this will be important going forward in your career.

I wanted to humbly request a reconsideration regarding the evaluation of my project submission. I understand there was an issue with building the Docker image from the repository. However, I had successfully built and pushed the Docker image earlier, and I believe it demonstrates that my solution is deployable. If the final evaluation was solely based on building from the repository, I\u2019m a bit confused about why the Docker image was considered earlier and why we were also asked to upload it to Docker Hub if it wasn\u2019t going to be taken into account later. Also the earlier evaluation score where we got some marks at least and now are hopes are crushed after one night. I do realize that in the real world, these kinds of errors can be critical, and I truly appreciate that the course is structured to prepare us for such expectations. That said, this course has been quite challenging, and for many students\u2014including myself\u2014it has been a source of considerable stress and demotivation. I sincerely request that you kindly consider awarding some partial marks for the working Docker image that was built and pushed earlier. It does reflect an understanding of deployable solutions, which I\u2019ve worked hard to demonstrate. I know you all have our best interests in mind, and I\u2019m grateful for the efforts put into making this a rigorous and enriching course. My only concern is that such harsh penalties\u2014especially for a single oversight\u2014can significantly affect our CGPA and future opportunities. I hope my request can be considered with empathy.

Try to look for what caused this error.\nAnswer: My code uses npx to format Markdown files using Prettier, specifically via subprocess.run([\"npx\", \"prettier@3.4.2\", \"--write\", ...]) , which assumes that npx is available in the environment. However, since the Docker container is based on Linux and I didn\u2019t explicitly install Node.js or npx , this results in an error during evaluation. To test the functionality correctly, npx must be installed inside the running container. This can be fixed by entering the container and installing Node.js and npm using: bash: apt-get update && apt-get install -y nodejs npm Once installed, npx prettier@3.4.2 should work as expected.

Screenshot 2025-04-07 233513 805\u00d7197 9.52 KB Github repo submitted: GitHub - wasimansari-iitm/Project-AI-Agent Docker repo submitted: wasimansariiitm/my-ai-agent The previous evaluation was successfully conducted using my Docker image, which was responding as expected. However, during the subsequent evaluation, the image was rebuilt using my GitHub repo link, and unfortunately, the app.py file could not be found. As a result, my evaluation logs are missing from the evaluation logs bundle. I would like to respectfully bring this to your kind attention that the app.py file does exist in the repository, but it is located inside a subfolder: https://github.com/wasimansari-iitm/Project-AI-Agent/app/app.py . But as per the submission instructions, I provided the GitHub repo link only: https://github.com/wasimansari-iitm/Project-AI-Agent . Humbly stating, I did not anticipate that the image will be rebuilt from the GitHub repo at a later stage due to some unforeseen circumstances. Had I known this, I would have made sure the project repo was structured appropriately to support that scenario. To be noted, that the earlier evaluation ran smoothly, and the app responded to all queries as expected. I\u2019m unsure what to expect now or request, but I just wanted to bring this issue to your notice. Even if I manage to get a single answer correct upon a successful evaluation, it would mean a lot to me and contribute meaningfully to my overall score. I would be extremely grateful if you could look into my case and extend your support in this matter.

Edit 1: I just realized that the datagen script looked for the fonts in python 3.13/site-packages/\u2026 But my docker image is using the python:3.12-slim-bookworm. Could that be an issue? There was nothing specified about required python version or required python image to be used in docker in the project 1 requirements.

You need to have github cli installed on your system and need authentication for certain github api enpoint access. Once authenticated and providing the appropriate repo details you can  run this code using uv. \n# /// script\n# dependencies = [\n#   \"requests\",\n# ]\n# ///\n\nimport requests\nimport datetime as dt\nimport zoneinfo\nimport argparse\nimport os\nimport zipfile\n\nparser = argparse.\u2026 That way you will be able to identify why the error was occuring. The specific error itself means: Docker is trying to run the command uv inside your container, but it can\u2019t find the uv executable \u2014 it\u2019s not installed or not in the system PATH inside the container. If you did not run evaluate.py as specified in our live sessions by recreating the test environment and then running evaluate.py then it would not have reflected how your dockerised application would work.

This is with reference to your confirmation mail that my project 1 will be re-evaluated after end term I would like to sincerely apologize for the oversight in my Project 1 submission. Upon reviewing my GitHub repository, I realized that the file was named dockerfile (with a lowercase \u2018d\u2019) in the Github root repo instead of the required Dockerfile (with an uppercase \u2018D\u2019). While the contents of the file were correct and my project passed several evaluation tests, I understand that the evaluation script could not detect the Dockerfile due to this naming issue. I genuinely did not intend to deviate from the standard, and I now fully understand the importance of following naming conventions precisely. I humbly request you to kindly consider this as an honest mistake and allow a one-time exception, Please sir. This issue has unfortunately resulted in my project score being reduced to 0, which puts my overall course performance at risk. I assure you that I have learned from this experience and such an error will not occur again in the future.

And datagen.py (or a similar named file which we will not tell you ahead of time and will be provided as the query parameter in task A1) will normally be called by evaluate.py Inside the docker container, permission for the data folder is set by the Dockerfile which then allows your application to access the root folder inside your docker image and create the /data folder. So the workflow is like this (for your internal testing only\u2026 please follow the Project page for deliverables and evaluation to submit project successfully): You create your application server that serves 2 endpoints on localhost:8000 You create a docker image that runs this application server. You run the docker image using podman as described in the project page. For mimicking the testing conditions. You need two files: evaluate.py and datagen.py to be in the same folder where you are running these two scripts. Run evalute.py using uv. If your docker image is correctly configured and your application is correctly configured, then all the tasks run by evaluate.py will correctly tell you if the application is producing the right result for each task. Hope that gives clarity.

And in score section it\u2019s showing assignment not submitted. @Saransh_Saini\nAnswer: Your scores are evaluated on a site that is external to the seek portal and is not integrated with the seek portal. Therefore seek does not know if you have submitted or not and by default says that it has not been submitted because it cannot see your external evaluation. There will not be a fix for this for some time. Scores for GA1, GA2, GA3, GA4, GA5, Project1, Project2, ROE will NOT be inside your seek portal. The scores will only be visible in the dashboard. Just ignore anything inside seek portal. The dashboard is where all your subject score cards exists. As stated in multiple places on discourse as well as in live sessions, The final score is always your last submission. If your dashboard score does not match your final submission score on the assignment page, only then contact us regarding your marks.

Otherwise students sometimes claim that they looked and did not find any GAs (this has happened in the past). Hence the two stage verification. You still need to the submissions to get a score for the GA. The actual GA questions are on https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/ via the seek portal or on the Tools in Data Science introduction page. Its just a more robust way of ensuring that students have indeed viewed the GAs. As far your submission goes, we have your last submission and the score. We will check on our end why your submission has not reloaded into your browser. Normally these are stored in session storage. So if your browser has deleted them, it might have not loaded from our back end server. @s.anand will be able to confirm the reason for this problem. For the time being if you are making a fresh submission, just fill in all the answers in again, so that your latest submission will be marked correctly.

Howe\nAnswer: Good evening @carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini @s.anand Sir, I hope you are well According to the grading document, we were told that only the best 4 out of the 7 assessments would count towards our final grade. There was no mention of any bonus marks, and we were not informed about the +5 bonus marks for GA7 before the deadline. Because of other academic commitments like Project 2, some of us couldn\u2019t complete GA7. Recently, we found out that some students received an email saying they\u2019ve been given +5 bonus marks for GA7, which directly affects their final score and possibly their overall grade. Since this information wasn\u2019t shared earlier, we kindly request you to consider offering an alternative way for those who missed GA7 to earn the bonus marks. This could be through a submission review or another form of assessment. We genuinely hope for your understanding and would be very grateful if you could provide a chance for us to earn the bonus marks too. Best regards, Palaash V.

So here are the first steps towards making this thread a more informed one: What is the policy related to bonus for Diploma level courses as per grading policy docum\nAnswer: I hope this message finds you well @jkmadathil sir. Firstly, I would like to sincerely apologize for any misunderstandings that may have arisen. I have the utmost respect for the grading system and for the esteemed professors at IITM, and I deeply value the effort put into the course. However, as a student, I am hoping to clarify the criteria for earning bonus marks in the TDS course. Addressing the queries you raised in your post: What is the policy related to bonus for Diploma level courses as per grading policy document? In previous modules, such as Project 1, bonus marks were awarded for completing additional tasks (1 bonus mark per task if the code handled them correctly). Similarly, in GA4, bonus marks were given for replying in Discourse. These bonus marks, however, were specific to the respective modules and did not affect the final grading. What is the policy adopted in previous instances of TDS? I am not fully aware of the policies adopted in previous terms for the TDS course. Did anyone read the text related to bonus marks associated with GA7? I have read the email regarding GA7 and the associated bonus marks. The email states that: Dear Learner, DEADLINE: 10th April, 2025 23:59:59pm GA7 requires you to submit 3 peer evaluations, so that you may be graded for your submission. Please find the form link below to submit your evaluations. https://forms.gle/DhBW4xdKyv7hXhXD9 AFTER completing your initial 3 peer reviews which were sent in the previous email, if you submit 5 additional reviews, you will be awarded upto 5 BONUS MARKS to your final T score. For example if your final TDS score is 75, doing all 5 extra peer reviews can boost your final score in TDS to 80. You will have to submit the form 5 times (1 for each peer). Use the same form link to submit 5 different reviews. Your Bonus score will still be based on the metrics derived for the initial 3 peer reviews, but scaled for 5 peer reviews. You have been given the peer submissions as links to HTML files which you have to download and view in a browser. Does anyone know what should be done to get the bonus? From the information in the email, I infer that students who complete the additional reviews are eligible for bonus marks, which will be added to their overall total marks. Has anyone inquired about effort involved in getting the bonus? My peers and I have worked diligently to complete all required tasks, including the ROE and projects. Earning additional bonus marks is certainly a challenging milestone, and we understand that it requires considerable effort. After answering all the above, has someone actually tried to follow instructions in the \u201cmail\u201d to get the bonus? Unfortunately, I can\u2019t follow the instructions because I did not receive the email about submitting extra peer reviews, as it appears to have been sent to those who participated in GA7. \u2026 Given this context, I would appreciate it if you could kindly clarify the situation for students who completed all GAs from 1 to 6 (or did their best 4 GAs) but did not participate in GA7. Specifically, I would like to understand why only those who completed GA7 are receiving the bonus marks email regarding peer reviews. Please note that I ask this purely for clarification and with the utmost respect for the professors and the grading system, as I have no intention of creating controversy. I simply wish to understand the criteria. Thank you for your time and consideration @jkmadathil sir.

Since the beginning of the course, it has been emphasized that the TDS course focuses more on teamwork and collaborative learning than individual study. I fully believe this concept and worked together with my group. I created Colab files for 4 GAs for my peers(more than 250 peers must have benefited from it), and my peers supported me with Project 1 and 2. They were mainly responsible for helping me score the full marks in the first two minutes of the ROE release and we had a meeting after ROE, which was scheduled with you. I understand that earning bonus marks for GA7 will be difficult. However, I had no opportunity to participate in this process even after submitting six GAs, while attempting only GA7 (which I understand presents a slim chance) may grant me 5 bonus marks. I acknowledge that the chances are difficult, but many of my peers who didn\u2019t submit GA7, including myself, feel we deserve an opportunity. Sir, I am not questioning the grading system but I think it would have been helpful if we had known earlier that peer reviews in GA7 would be part of earning bonus marks. In GA4, Anand Sir made it clear that anyone who asked or answered a question in the GA4 discussion would receive bonus marks but these were specific to GA4 (e.g., a score of 110 out of 100), not the overall grading. To be clear, my query is why I am not being afforded the opportunity. I believe there may have been some confusion or lack of clear communication regarding the bonus system. I am not pointing out mistakes, but I just feel the information about the bonus could have been shared more clearly. Finally, I want to thank everyone with whom I have connected during this course. I am not questioning why others who submitted GA7 are eligible for a bonus, but I am simply asking why I am not eligible, especially after submitting six GAs, the ROE, and two projects. I know that the world is much more than 5 marks, but I am only seeking clarity on the situation. I\u2019d also like to mention that with the end-term exams just three days away, most of us will be focusing on preparing for them. However, I trust you\u2019ll definitely take our concerns into consideration, and we remain hopeful for clarity regarding the bonus marks.

Here is the main query that most people are having: 23f2004636: To be clear, my query is why I am not being afforded the opportunity. I believe there may have been some confusion or lack of clear communication regarding the bonus system. Here is my response, and I have consulted with the course instructors before sharing this: Every term in TDS, both instructors and students are not aware of what bonuses are going to be given out at the start of term. Bonus activities are created at any point, at the discretion of the course team, and the information is not disseminated in a wide fashion. It\u2019s primarily a reward mechanic for those that really are interested in engaging in the whole breadth of the course. For instance, in the last two terms the bonus activities required them to post their solutions in Discourse where the problem statement. The course team do not invent GAs for the sake of giving opportunities for scoring marks. They are opportunities to learn and put that learning to use. Another goal is for the GAs to be opportunities to learn by collaborating with each other. 192 students took that opportunity to engage with GA7. If no one is interested in doing the GA, then why should the team take the effort to create it? Would you rather prefer that we make it mandatory for all students to do all GAs (by making GAA = average of all GA Scores)? Some courses do that. We were very lenient in our GA scoring because the course is tough. Students benefitted from that leniency. Should we reverse our leniency so that everyone \u201cgets the opportunity to get bonus marks?\u201d Think about this As a course team, they did not know beforehand that they were going to give opportunities for any bonuses when GA 7 was created. So there was no information to give. Please do understand that the course team do not knowingly hide things from students (that\u2019s a viewpoint that some students seem to suggest with their posts or at least). When we saw that some students were taking the effort to do GA7, we decided that we would give them an opportunity as a reward for their diligence, to try and obtain some bonus marks. Are you jealous of their diligence? It is extraordinary that it appears you would prefer if those students, who actually put in the effort, would not be given the opportunity! You have not been able to avail the opportunity because you decided that doing GA 7 is not worth the effort at all. They thought it was worth the effort before there was any chance of a bonus. And now you begrudge them that reward for their own diligence. Once again reiterating this point - Bonus marks are given for activities to students at the discretion of the course team. It always has been. And it has never been widely available to all students in past terms of TDS either. This term is no exception. They are never decided beforehand. They are created as and when there seems to be an appropriate opportunity to reward students for their effort. The 192 students that decided to do GA7 deservedly have that opportunity. But it\u2019s not guaranteed for them either. They have to put in a significant coordinated effort with their peers to actually achieve that. In other words, it\u2019s not a freebie. I had promised to provide the distribution of people who did GA7 both in terms of number of assignments done and average score in GAA. Here is the data below: # Assignments Done # students 0 42 1 33 2 22 3 19 4 23 5 28 Assignment_Score # students 0-10 75 11-20 19 21-30 15 31-40 9 41-50 13 51-60 7 61-70 11 71-80 12 81-90 10 91-100 17", "Title: Bonus Marks in TDS for Jan 25\nQuestion: It is good to see that you have been actively collaborating with your peers and both have benefitted from this.

I completely understand that bonus marks are at the discretion of the course team and are meant to reward diligence and deeper engagement \u2014 which is fair. However, I just want to point out a potential nuance: Many of the 192 students who did GA7 may have done so not for extra learning but simply to ensure their top 4 GAs included 4 full scores (e.g., to replace a lower-scoring GA). So the distinction between diligence-for-learning and diligence-for-grade-maximizing becomes blurred. Now that bonus marks are announced after the deadline, those who already had 4 perfect scores and skipped GA7 based on the stated structure (top 4 out of 7) are essentially penalized for playing the game by the original rules \u2014 not for a lack of diligence or engagement. I\u2019m not questioning the bonus system itself, just pointing out that such surprises can unintentionally favor certain strategies over others \u2014 and more transparency around this in future terms might help students make better-informed decisions without second-guessing themselves later.", "Title: Bonus Marks in TDS for Jan 25\nQuestion: It is good to see that you have been actively collaborating with your peers and both have benefitted from this.

If the team wants to award the bonus marks for the consistent performance then they should consider the best 5 or 6 GAs and award bonus accordingly. It is unfair that those who just attempted GA7 are been given bonus marks to the entire course. If you wish to provide bonus marks then provide the bonus marks for GA7 alone, the same way as it was done for GA4. The main issue is that the bonus marks concept was never informed prior. The team should not take actions at random as it would affect many students. As per grading document, only best 4 out of 7 GAs were supposed to be considered. Even if the team wishes to give the bonus mark then it should be given to the GA7 alone and not entire total score. Sir as per the current logic, say a person just attends GA7 alone and doesnt attend any another thing then he would also be awarded bonus 5 marks to his total score just because of the fact that they attended GA7. Whereas students who have been submitting Ga1 to 6 and werent able to submit GA7 alone as per current logic are not being considered for the bonus mark. This is unfair. Please think from our side.

Are you jealous of their diligence? @jkmadathil Sir, this sounds reasonably fair. But, what about the students who were lethargic in probably week 1 or week 2, thinking that they can solve the GAs of later weeks? They also get benefitted from this. I think the attitude of these students is the same as those who skipped GA& as they got 100% GAA within the first five or six weeks", "Title: Bonus Marks in TDS for Jan 25\nQuestion: @carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini Greetings sir! Sir, I have a query about the criteria for earning bonus marks in the TDS course. I\u2019ve noticed that some students who completed GA7 are receiving bonus marks for extra peer reviews (5 bonus marks is quite significant as it improves grades as well). Howe\nAnswer: I wanted to follow up on my previous message regarding the 5 bonus marks for GA7 and further elaborate on the impact this may have on overall grades. As outlined in the grading document, the best 4 out of 7 GA assignments carry a total of 15 marks. Since many students, including myself, scored well in our best 4 assignments, which were prioritized as we aimed to maximize our grades, we did not attempt GA7. The bonus marks for GA7 were announced after the deadline, which has led to a concern that this may create an imbalance in the overall grading. For students who excelled in their top 4 assignments, the additional 5 marks from GA7 may not significantly alter their overall grade, as they have already demonstrated strong performance. Conversely, those who struggled initially and attempted GA7 in hopes of improving their grade may benefit more from this bonus. This could inadvertently disadvantage those of us who strategically focused on the highest scoring opportunities available to us. Given that the bonus marks were introduced after grades were finalized, I respectfully ask if there\u2019s a possibility to consider an adjustment in these", "Title: Bonus Marks in TDS for Jan 25\nQuestion: It is good to see that you have been actively collaborating with your peers and both have benefitted from this. Here is the main query that most people are having: 23f2004636: To be clear, my query is why I am not being afforded the opportunity. I believe there may have been some confusion or lack o\nAnswer: Thank you for taking the time to respond in detail. I\u2019d like to respectfully share a few clarifications in response to some of the points raised. jkmadathil: When we saw that some students were taking the effort to do GA7, we decided that we would give them an opportunity as a reward for their diligence, to try and obtain some bonus marks. Are you jealous of their diligence? With due respect sir, I want to clarify that in my original message, I stated: \u201cI am not questioning why others who submitted GA7 are eligible for a bonus, but I am simply asking why I am not eligible\u2026I know that the world is much more than 5 marks, but I am only seeking clarity on the situation.\u201d As mentioned above, my intention was never to express jealousy . It was simply an enquiry for clarity, especially around the communication and criteria related to the bonus system. The assumption that those who did not attempt GA7 chose not to put in effort is not accurate, respectfully. jkmadathil: You have not been able to avail the opportunity because you decided that doing GA 7 is not worth the effort at all. I would like to point out that many of us, myself included, showed consistent diligence by completing and submitting GA1 through GA6. Personally, I solved GA5 and GA6 even after solving my Best 4 GAs purely for the learning experience , knowing they wouldn\u2019t necessarily impact my grade directly. I never avoided GA7 out of carelessness\u2014I simply prioritized the fact that only the best 4 GA scores would count. This is not a lack of effort or interest in the subject matter. Further, you mentioned: jkmadathil: The 192 students that decided to do GA7 deservedly have that opportunity. I completely respect the effort put in by those students. However, I would like to offer another perspective: what if some among those 192 had not completed their best 4 GAs prior to GA7? Meanwhile, those of us who consistently completed all previous GAs(excluding GA7) from the start are now excluded from this opportunity\u2014not due to lack of interest, but due to lack of communication. If the bonus is truly a recognition of effort specific to GA7 , then it might be more fair to reflect that in the GA7 score only, not in the overall course total , which affects students who were consistently involved across the term. I know I\u2019m still learning and have a long way to go\u2014there\u2019s so much about the world, professionalism, and fairness that I hope to understand better through experiences and guidance of professors and through the exposure from the college. But I also believe that seeking clarity is part of that learning. Thank you once again for reading my message and considering my point of view.", "Title: Bonus Marks in TDS for Jan 25\nQuestion: It is good to see that you have been actively collaborating with your peers and both have benefitted from this. Here is the main query that most people are having: 23f2004636: To be clear, my query is why I am not being afforded the opportunity. I believe there may have been some confusion or lack o\nAnswer: Thank you for the response sir, however my doubt was regarding a different issue. It is not that I am jealous of their diligence or anything, its simply that even from the data you provided above, it seems that a majority of students, 141 out of the 192 students have not actually even done 4 assignments. So they might have done GA7 for the 4 GAA criteria, not just due to diligence. Once again I am not stating that they were all like that, but rather it is a possibility. Another issue is that a lot of students might have originally worked hard on earlier assignments to score well but may not have had the time for later assignments such as college students like myself who have end term examinations ongoing currently. Since I saw that I had already put in the effort to do all 6 assignments prior, I only did not do the GA7 since it clashed with my examinations. Once again I am not blaming the instructors for this situation sir but the bonus 5 marks can very well change which grade we get in the end, which is the reason why I have created this message. The students who have attempted GA7 do deserve extra marks for their work but if others were informed of the extra 5 marks then we may have also taken part in it, even if we had other prior commitments.

This shows their \u201cdiligence\u201d which you are awarding them for. Whereas the students like us who have been submitting all the projects and the assignments GA1 to 6, how can the team conclude that just because we didnt submit GA7 we are not diligent enough to be awarded the bonus marks. Shouldnt the bonus marks be awarded to those students who have been submitting literally all 2 projects and 6 assignments(6/7 i.e 85% of the assignments)? How could the team decide to award bonus 5 marks to the overall score just to those students based on a single assignment( namely GA7).  We are genuinely struggling, and we are requesting bonus marks based on that. Please don\u2019t misunderstand our request as jealousy \u2014 it comes from a place of hardship. How can a student who submitted 1 assignment make him more diligent than those who have been submitting 2 projects and 6 assignments. I think if you plan to award bonus marks you should consider best 5 or 6 assignments and not just based on a single assignment. Just because we didnt submit a assignment(GA7) why are we being deprived of the bonus marks which was not even informed of. If you want to provide the bonus marks then you can also consider the best 4 assignments as well as it would also show the students\u2019 interest and diligence as you said. If you want to consider for the bonus marks you can consider any assignment right, why just GA7 is the question. You can also award the bonus marks based of GA-1 or GA-2 or so. I think the diligence which are talking of, should be measured based on consistent performance and not just based on a single assignment.

Mishkat Chougule", "Title: Bonus Marks in TDS for Jan 25\nQuestion: To all the people who are posting in this thread, I kindly request you to get the correct facts and data before starting a new thread. So here are the first steps towards making this thread a more informed one: What is the policy related to bonus for Diploma level courses as per grading policy docum\nAnswer: Hi everyone, A bit of data might be useful. Its been interesting reading all your posts, I thought I might share some brief insights. Firstly students vastly overestimate the ease of getting bonus marks in TDS. So of the approx 200 students that did GA7: The top bonus mark was 3. Only 2 students managed it. Going by that statistic, of the 600 students who are active in TDS, possibly 6 might have even managed to get 3 or more marks. So lets not pretend that this was easy by any stretch of the imagination. The mean bonus score was 1.27. So, on average, you would get less than a 1/3rd GAs worth of marks for the extra effort of an entire GA+extra work. The psychology study it revealed however is interesting on this thread to see. The difference between perception and reality. My advice is stop reacting emotionally and evaluate rationally. That is the data for you. Student Bonus 600\u00d7371 7.62 KB Also noteworthy Bonus marks in TDS are never made known ahead of time for any term in the past and neither will it be in the future. None of us knew that there were going to be bonuses after the submission of GA7. Please stop requesting, \u201cat least you should let us know before GA7\u201d. How can we let you know, if we ourselves were not aware there were going to be bonus marks? Bonuses are always surprise opportunities that are not widely available to everyone. For example we never release them on the seek portal. In the past Anand has released them on discourse, where typically, in previous terms, less than a fraction of a third of the students are even engaged, let alone active. Of course students in the past complained saying, they did not know and were not informed. To which the response was, maybe you should be more actively engaged on discourse. How many people typically tried TDS bonus in the past? Probably around 50. So compared to previous terms, this term is a huge improvement! Bonuses are not a right. They are opportunities that become available for those that are engaged with the course. Where and when that opportunity becomes available varies. A bit like real life. However we have read all your concerns and we have decided to put a disclaimer in the grading document for future terms: Opportunities for bonus marks might become available for activities linked to any of the GAs, Projects or Course Modules. The may be revealed at anytime, on any platform (seek, discourse, course site) and through any medium (official email, discourse) at the discretion of the course team. Bonus marks are not guaranteed and are awarded at the discretion of the course team.", "Title: Bonus Marks in TDS for Jan 25\nQuestion: Hi everyone, A bit of data might be useful.

Thats why the bonus marks are low. Also the there is minimum requirement for even being eligible for it, i.e. you must complete GA7 and give 3 peer reviews before you can even be considered for bonus eligibility.\nAnswer: Hi @carlton sir and @Jivraj sir, Sir, As per your instructions, I had reached out to my peers well in advance; however, only 3 out of 8 responded. While 2\u20133 of the worksheets were publicly accessible, many remained private despite the ample time provided. This raises the possibility that the individual assigned to grade those particular sheets\u2014aside from myself\u2014may also not have had access, potentially affecting the overall grading accuracy. Additionally, I noticed that some worksheets were largely incomplete or just a single sheet was provided, and there is a chance that a few participants may have copy-pasted their own values because the if the sheet were provide and access wasn\u2019t given, the probability of the correct values being there was really high, which could further influence the evaluations. Admittedly there were quite a lot of empty sheets too which I gave zero as deserved but this might not have been the case with other evaluators. Given these factors, I wanted to kindly request clarification on how these were handled. Was there a specific threshold required to qualify for the bonus, and how are such inconsistencies accounted Sir, some of us(including me) have submitted all 7 GAs and despite the end term we approached peers and completed all 8 reviews even when we had already got 90-110 in first four with average being 100 so I hope we could be graded fairly and appropriately for our efforts.", "Title: Bonus Marks in TDS for Jan 25\nQuestion: The rubric is challenging and requires some level of collaboration with others.

I don\u2019t see how there could have been large variances in scores different evaluators would have given to a student.

The  course\u2019s rules  seems to be changed on a whim, which is pretty unfair to those of us who completed the first 6 assignments properly. If anything, why not inform the +5 bonus before declaring the GA-7. \u201cRewarding diligence\u201d is a vague point as completing 6 out of 7 assignments requires a decent commitment to the course. Getting rewarded for completing all 7 assignments is something absolutely commendable, without a doubt but getting a +5 on the basis of simply GA-7 is vague because it doesn\u2019t guarantee the commitment towards the other 6 assignments.

It has two parts to it. The first part is the TAs solving the Mock in real time (however this is not a solutions session). The purpose of it is to get you to realise some key things: The chaos of ROE. The adrenaline, speed of thought, the need to be very familiar with your tools. The limited time you have to use GPT effectively. It will help you with minor work flows, but not with complex tasks. (watch the session debrief to hear a clear articulation about this). The value of efficient and effective collaboration. A hodgepodge of many people will not make an effective solutions team. The ABSOLUTE importance of creating your own cheat sheet with code snippets that will help you solve ROE quickly Workflow of ROE: Data Extraction \u2192 Data Cleaning \u2192 Data Transformation \u2192 Data Analyisis \u2192 Information to answer questions The pitfalls of getting fixated on a question (a very common mistake and you can see it happen in the real time solving session as well). How limited the time is. The second part of the session was a debrief for the sheer shock that students felt. The goal of the mock was to acclimatise you to the shock of ROE. Past terms never had this benefit. We thought to take the shock factor out so that you can be better prepared than any term before. Emotions were raw. But this is normal. What is unusual is to have a preview of it before ROE. So the discussions were very intense even for us. Today\u2019s Mock ROE will be more like a traditional solving session and deal with new aspects. It has the added bonus of being hosted on an exam server (without a time limit). I would still STRONGLY advise setting a horrible sounding alarm to acclimatise to the pressure cooker of ROE. You will make stupid mistakes under pressure. The TAs did yesterday as well. So best to reduce this factor by getting used to the clock.

Some tasks require downloading libraries, whereas you may already have these libraries or other necessary setups in place, which naturally reduces your solving time. As you are aware, additional time will only benefit those who have prepared and possess the required knowledge. Students without preparation will not gain any advantage simply due to an extension. Furthermore, as the course has been modified from the previous term and many aspects are still being refined, we have already requested measures to support our performance and ensure our grades are not put at undue risk. I genuinely prioritize knowledge over marks and have put in significant effort to excel in this course. However, I do not want to risk failing. My goal is simply to meet  the passing criteria (at least 40 marks) . Therefore, I sincerely request you to consider granting additional time for the ROE as a reasonable relief.

At least tell us , what is llm and what is use of , everything is going to above of \nAnswer: Hi Hari, The goal of the course was never to go deep into specific technologies, with perhaps the exception of LLMs as major tooling capability for data science. Due to the volume of the content in the first 3 weeks it was decided to at least get students sufficient information to be able to do the Graded Assignments. One of the criticisms we received last term was that the sessions were too slow because we were covering from the very basics. So it was a conscious decision to speed up and shorten the explanations. Of course this is always difficult to get right because we respond to students in sessions. This is why attending the sessions is more valuable than watching the sessions. We cannot effectively gauge what level to pitch at if the audience is silent or not involved. We can only guess the level of the vast silent mass of students.

A1: The trajectory has moved from hard to easy. This GA is much easier and lighter than previous ones. Q2: How do I extract a table from HTML using Google Sheets? A2: This functionality is available in Google Sheets but not in Excel (unless you use plugins). The function will give you a #NAME? error in Excel. Q3: How can I extract data from the ODI Batsman Stats webpage? A3: I\u2019ll show you how to extract data from a different webpage, but you can find a similar example in my previous live session on YouTube. Q4: What do the parameters in the function mean? A4: The four parameters are: URL, query (either \u201clist\u201d or \u201ctable\u201d), index (table number), and locale. The index is zero-based (like Python). Q5: How does the function automatically find the table? A5: It finds the table based on the index you provide. If there are multiple tables, you\u2019ll need to adjust the index accordingly. Q6: How can I extract d", "Title: Tools in Data Science\nContent: Live Session: 17 Jan 2025 Q1: How to solve question number 7 (counting Wednesdays between two dates)? A1: Use Excel. Input the two dates into two cells. Use a command to find the difference in days, then divide by 7 to get the number of weeks. Since there\u2019s one Wednesday per week, that\u2019s the number of Wednesdays. If the start date isn\u2019t a Wednesday, a different approach is needed. Q2: How to handle dates that don\u2019t start on a Wednesday? A2: Instead of starting from the given date, start from the next day (e.g., if it starts on Tuesday, start on Wednesday). Calculate the difference in days and divide by 7. The method of simply dividing by 7 might not always give the correct answer, so the logic needs to be adjusted based on the starting day. Another approach is to start from the nearest Wednesday and iterate using a while loop, but this is less efficient. Q3: How to extract a CSV file from a zip file? A3: This is considered a basic task. Use a file explorer or command-line tools. The in", "Title: Tools in Data Science\nContent: Live Session: 15 Jan 2025 Q1: Where can I find the uploaded documents? A1: The uploaded documents are added as part of a YouTube playlist. You should be able to see them on YouTube. Q2: How should I approach TDS? A2: The best way to learn TDS is through practice. The course is designed to handle day-to-day data science problems. It introduces everyday development tools (from VS Code to npm) and provides hands-on experience solving problems. The graded assignments (GAs) are practical exercises designed to reinforce theoretical concepts. Focus on working through the examples and familiarizing yourself with the tools. Q3: I\u2019m new to this field and struggling with basic concepts. What should I do? A3: GA0 is a self-assessment. If you scored above 50%, you have a good foundation. If not, consider additional learning before proceeding. The course is hands-on, and the TAs will hold sessions to help you understand the tools.

Results will be announced by 26 Feb 2025. For questions, use this Discourse thread . Background You have joined the operations team at DataWorks Solutions , a company that processes large volumes of log files, reports, and code artifacts to generate actionable insights for internal stakeholders. In order to improve operational efficiency and consistency, the company has mandated that routine tasks be automated and integrated into their Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline. Due to the unpredictable nature of incoming data (from logs, ticket systems, source code, surveys, etc.) the team has decided to use a Large Language Model (LLM) as an intermediate transformer. In this role, the LLM will perform small, reasonably deterministic tasks. Your assignment is to build an automation agent that accepts plain\u2011English tasks, carries out the required (multi\u2011step) process leveraging an LLM where required.

A1: The first assignment was easy, the second was hard, the third was average, and the fourth seems easy. However, the instructor notes that the first assignment was only easy for those with a technical background; for most students, it was very difficult. The difficulty level of subsequent assignments will decrease. Q2: Where can I find the recording of yesterday\u2019s session? A2: It\u2019s already uploaded to your calendar associated with your IIT-DS ID. It takes Google about an hour or two to process the video. Q3: How do I use the BBC Weather API to get weather data for a specific location? A3: First, use the BBC location service API to get the location ID for your city (e.g., Delhi). You can use the Thunder Client extension or Postman to send the API request. The instructor demonstrates using Postman. Once you have the location ID, use it in the BBC Weather API endpoint.

A1: We will be discussing the function calling part of OpenAI. We will create a program that takes user prompts in English, identifies which function to call based on the prompt, and then calls that function. Q2: What is the first step in the process? A2: First, we import the library. Then, we\u2019ll get the headers and URL for the request, and finally, we\u2019ll create a JSON body for the request. Q3: What is the goal of the program? A3: The program aims to automate the process of ordering something from an online store. It will take a user\u2019s order in plain English, understand the request, and place the order. It will also include a feature for updating existing orders. Q4: How will the program understand the user\u2019s prompt? A4: The program will send the user\u2019s prompt to OpenAI.

A1: An ML (Machine Learning) project involves more factors than just fitting models. The \u201cfitting of six models\u201d project was a simplified version done for a friend\u2019s certification course. It involved training six models on a pre-cleaned dataset with some hyperparameter tuning but minimal data preprocessing or cleaning. Q2: Is the TDS project designed to provide a level playing field for everyone, considering some participants may lack coding experience? A2: The TDS project aims to combine everything learned in the course so far. It might seem challenging, especially for those without a coding background.

It is written in the Tools in Data Science that we can expose the api using vercel (the example given also uses vercel). But I don\u2019t think vercel can handle/allow many operations, some of them are listed below. In GA 1 ques 13 and  GA 2 Ques 7, we have to create github repo, then creating github actions and then retrieve the raw github file url. We can accomplish this using Github CLI gh which we have to install in the vercel instance using apt package manager. But, Vercel does not provide sudo access which is required to install packages. In GA 2 ques 10, we have to use local LLM (Llamafile), will vercel allow that? Also after that, we have to give answer as the ngrok public url for which we have to first install ngrok package. In GA 2 ques 8,  uploading an image to Dockerhub requires docker package installed. In GA 2 ques 6, Deploy a Python API to Vercel in a Vercel instance? Many ques require writing and running FastAPI server to serve data with CORS enabled. Can Vercel allow/do that? And many more Most tasks mentioned above like installing packages etc. requires sudo privilages or may face restrictions set by Vercel. Vercel does not provide sudo access or any form of root access to its hosting environment which is required to perform the above tasks. Many of these task can be done in our local systems (exposing to internet using cloudflare tunnels/ngrok), but we cannot run our systems 24*7 during evaluation. I can see only one option left that is renting a VPS from server providers like digitalocean, gcp, aws etc, which will provide us sudo access and 100% uptime. Also, some ques requires external toolings like In GA1 ques 5, it is written to explicitly use Excel and this will only work in Office 365. In GA1 ques 6, we have to use Devtools to show/find the hidden element in the question. Now, the question parameter in the POST request will be plain text, so how the element can hide there? GA 2 ques 4 and GA 2 ques 5 uses Google Colab specific python libraries like google.colab which can\u2019t be installed locally. How to solve these above questions that require explicit usage of external tools. Also, handling POST request for some questions are not clear like In GA 2 ques 2, we have to compress the image and upload the image as answer. So, now how to response such answer in json object. Should we encode the resultant compressed image as base64 string or Image URL or  Data URI. Some ques have images in them. For those images in GAs, I right clicked and used \u201cSave as\u201d to save the images and then done the required computations. So, now when this question will be sent as POST request, will the image be included as the base64 encoded string in the question parameter of the POST request itself or as an optional file attachment? Another concern is regarding the OpenAI API TOKEN, unlike Project 1, Project 2 does not have an API_TOKEN parameter in the POST request. Hence, the API TOKEN provided from https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev will be also used during evaluation. Now, what will happen if our API TOKEN credits gets end during evaluation. The LLM will throw errors then. Please advise what we should do. please clarify Sir.", "Can you provide with an evaluation file like we had for Project 1.", "Can we have groups for this please? @Jivraj @carlton @s.anand", "If you are talking about the parameters of those questions, then it would be better if you make your API capable of working with different parameters.", "Well if your API is capable of solving those questions in your GAs with the expected answer, then that\u2019s sufficient validation.", "If you are indicating towards working collaboratively then, Yes, we encourage you to collaborate with others and collectively work towards solving this project. Even if you are going for the relatively easiest approach of Function Calling, it would require you to code about 50 functions to solve all your tasks. Which is why it is sensible to work collectively.", "Hello Sir, I have a few questions. Would like your thoughts and suggestions over the same. Currently answers that we have entered for GA\u2019s 1 to 4 are not available and only for GA5 its available. It would be helpful for the project (when running the Curl command for each of the question) if the assignments can display the answers we\u2019ve entered as well for verification purposes. The first question of GA1 q1 needs for us to run vs code but when executing it through vercel its not possible because vercel is a serverless environment. In this case, is it okay to manually enter the answer in the code, so when the question is triggered it takes the manual output from the code. Can you provide some clarity as to how the question is supposed to be and structured ? Or should the code be able to handle multiple variants of the question? To address this concern, i tried to implement sentence_transformers using a lightweight model but the vercel application build failed saying that the data is too long and that Vercel serverless function deployment size exceeds the limit of 250 MB. Should i consider deploying elsewhere or change the approach? How do we handle questions pertaining to Devtools - creating input box etc. Thanks and Regards Shalini", "What does it mean to solve the question? Everyone is asking that?

Extending the deadline wont be disadvantage also, project2 will be like ET preparation Please consider this request sir Thanks", "I just want to know if you prefer using an existing language model application where we utilize an LLM (Large Language Model), train it, and format the output. For instance, I used the Gemini API key, integrated it with Python, and then formatted the results with the help of Copilot to achieve the desired outputs. Alternatively, do you want us to create a new LLM model and train it with questions from graded assignments? I\u2019m curious about your preference. Additionally, would you like the LLM to provide specific answers regarding computer specifications, or should it give general specifications? For example, in Graded Assignment 1, there is a question about the editor: Visual Studio Code. Your editor is the most important tool in your arsenal; that\u2019s where you\u2019ll spend most of your time, so make sure you\u2019re comfortable with it. Visual Studio Code is, by far, the most popular code editor today. According to the 2024 Stack Overflow Survey, almost 75% of developers use it. We recommend you learn it well. Even if you use another editor, you\u2019ll likely work with others who use VS Code, so having some exposure is beneficial. To get started, you can watch these introductory videos (totaling 35 minutes) from the Visual Studio Docs: Getting Started: Set up and learn the basics of Visual Studio Code (7 min) Code Editing: Learn how to edit and run code in VS Code (3 min) Productivity Tips: Become a VS Code power user with these productivity tips (4 min) Personalize: Personalize VS Code to make it yours with themes (2 min) Extensions: Add features, themes, and more to VS Code with extensions (4 min) Debugging: Get started with debugging in VS Code (6 min) Version Control: Learn how to use Git version control in VS Code (3 min) Customize: Learn how to customize your settings and keyboard shortcuts in VS Code (6 min) AI Editors: Copilot, Cursor Note: AI editors like Cursor, Cody, and GitHub Copilot use LLMs to help you write code faster. These tools are built on top of VS Code and have become standard in every developer\u2019s toolkit. Please make sure to use them. To install and run Visual Studio Code, open your Terminal (or Command Prompt) and type code -s , then press Enter. Copy and paste the entire output below. What is the output of code -s ? The output of code -s cannot be universally answered because it depends on the user\u2019s system and the specific version of VS Code installed. The question requests the output of a command that is unique to each user. As for the part about getting answers from the LLM model, I believe that may require using an AI agent.

Clarification needed: How is this expected to be evaluated? Deployment-Related Issues (To Be Included in Thursday\u2019s Session) Please include discussion and solutions for the following deployment issues: Platform Capability for GA Tasks Which cloud platform (Azure, DigitalOcean, etc.) can handle all GA tasks reliably?

File Upload Example via Platform API Request: Please provide examples for both small and large file uploads using API from a cloud-deployed app. This would help validate deployments for assignment questions involving file input. General Observations on GA1-5 Output Accuracy: Approximately 80% of the questions in GA1-5 return correct output when tested on a local machine.

Kind regards", "I would request the TDS team to please consider making the evaluation criteria for project 2 a bit more liberal. 5 random Questions with 4 marks each is quite harsh. I request you to make it more balanced like 2 Qs from each GA with 2 marks each or so. So that even if we can\u2019t exhaustively cover the whole number of questions, it gives mercy for the partial completion. 5 random question is a kind of lottery or luck based unless our app is perfect. Thanks @carlton @s.anand", "Hey guys, I have designed the code, and it currently works for the first 11 GA1 questions and the sixth and third questions of GA2. I have accounted for all edge cases. Please check the code at this link: https://4e52-43-230-106-58.ngrok-free.app/ . Let me know your thoughts!", "@carlton , @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini GA2 - Question 3: Publish a Page Using GitHub Pages As part of the requirement, I successfully published a webpage using GitHub Pages that includes my email address 21f3001076@ds.study.iitm.ac.in in the HTML content. The page functions correctly and becomes accessible on my local system. To automate the publishing process, I implemented a delay function that checks for the page\u2019s availability after 5 seconds. Based on testing, GitHub Pages typically take around 10\u201320 seconds to go live after repository creation and HTML deployment. As a result, the complete process\u2014from initiating the API call to verifying that the page is live\u2014takes approximately 30 seconds locally. This setup works reliably on my local machine. However, when deploying the same process on Azure, I encountered an issue. Without the delay, the API responds too quickly\u2014before the GitHub Pages site is actually live\u2014resulting in a broken or non-functional link on the assignment portal. On the other hand, including the delay function causes Azure to throw a 502 Bad Gateway error, likely due to Azure\u2019s request timeout limitations. The additional wait time slightly exceeds the platform\u2019s allowed response duration. GA4 - Question 9: Process PDF Files A similar issue occurs in GA4 Question 9, where the task involves processing PDF files. While this works perfectly in the local environment, it leads to a 502 Bad Gateway error on Azure. This is due to the relatively long time required to parse and analyze the PDFs, which again exceeds Azure\u2019s execution time limit. Moreover, pre-processing the PDF files is not an option because the input varies for each user. Therefore, the PDFs must be processed dynamically, which adds to the delay and contributes to the timeout problem. Currently, I am using Azure for deployment, and for the majority of tasks, it works reliably. Although these specific tasks face timeout issues, shifting to another deployment platform is not feasible at this point. I am not certain if alternative platforms will work consistently across all questions, and making such a change could introduce failures in other parts of the assignment where Azure performs well.

I\u2019d like to share a few reflections\u2014not as criticism, but as constructive feedback with the intention to contribute positively to future iterations. Organization & Structure: The project felt a bit unstructured at times, which may be expected given that this is possibly the first time such an initiative is being carried out. I\u2019m not blaming anyone\u2014just sharing my thoughts. I hope positive insights can be drawn from this feedback. Deployment & Portal Limitations: There are noticeable limitations on the deployment side (e.g., timeouts, platform constraints) and occasional issues on the assignment portal. While frustrating, these also led to some deep technical learning. Time Constraints: Balancing this project with ongoing coursework and other responsibilities has been quite demanding. The deadline of March 31st adds pressure, making it difficult to thoroughly test all 57 questions across different environments. Sessions & Support: The sessions conducted were helpful in addressing specific topics, but in many areas, I had to rely heavily on GPT and self-guided exploration to move forward. Deployment Variability: Each GA\u2019s questions seemed to expose different limitations depending on the deployment platform. This inconsistency made it hard to predict which questions would work reliably. Effort Acknowledgment: I sincerely appreciate the efforts of the TAs and instructors\u2014it\u2019s clear that a lot of hard work went into enabling and supporting this project. However, it\u2019s also a bit disappointing that we, as students, are unsure which questions are expected to work and which may fail\u2014even the team might not have full visibility over this at the moment. Feasibility in the Given Timeline: Even for someone with a technical background, it\u2019s difficult to troubleshoot and experiment across so many cases within the current timeline. Trying different approaches per question isn\u2019t always feasible before the deadline. I genuinely hope someone is able to complete all 57 questions successfully\u2014I\u2019d love to learn from their experience and solutions. Again, this post is meant in a positive and constructive spirit. If anything I said seems inappropriate or off the mark, please let me know\u2014I\u2019m happy to edit or delete the post if needed.

Is it joking? Our teachers don\u2019t have enough time to make a separate video for project to explain what to do and how to do? I already have done two project courses and they taught us, even they made 2 - groups just only for discussions in which one is personal and also made a YouTube playlist especially for project. They explained what should be your approach? How to make project? And here, they took only one session just only for show off. And they organised that single session when too many student requests too many times? Are we studying in IIT - The top institute of India or in a cheap and lower than third class government schools. It is the responsibility of our teachers to explain the project, but they are just showing off. Even they never provided the solutions for assignments also. Is it not our right to get solutions so that we can know where we did mistake? They don\u2019t have time to make solutions, they just made an assignment checker which checks the assignments automatically. I don\u2019t think so that they really made any effort in our course. In project-2 also, we need solutions for all graded assignments and so many students request for solutions but our the great teachers ignores the request and didn\u2019t provide the solutions. I think they provide the projects whatever comes in their dreams during sleeping. In weekly study material, don\u2019t have their notes, even they have a very few videos made by them, they just render to other YouTuber\u2019s Youtube videos and online websites. Are we paid just only for these YouTube videos ? If we can understand everything just only from YouTube then why we are studying from the India\u2019s top Engineering institute - The IIT Madras? I have much more better videos than that are provided on YouTube and created by other YouTubers. They only have some points copy pasted from documentations, but they never tried to explain them. Just read, copy and paste in your program. What is it, why it is used for, don\u2019t ask anything. Some students request for extending the time limit of [roject-2 just only for one day, but what was their excuse- \"We won\u2019t be able to extend deadline, if we do, then evaluations will get delayed. \". I want to ask them, where is the result of Project-1? The first date of result declaration was 26-Feb, then their another date was 16-March, but until now on 2-Apr, we do not get our results. It is more than 45 days, what is this going on? Nobody tried to ask with our great teachers. But on extending the deadline of project-2 just only for one day, their evaluation will be late. In project-2, we have to continue running our project until they will not evaluate, whether they take more than 1, 2 or more months. Either we have to host online by paying or run our own system for 24x7 unto when, we also don;t know as their result date is also not fixed, it is just a combination of letters and numbers showing on portal. It is our tales it is my right to get solutions for every weekly assignment, but don\u2019t ask them to make efforts. Just pay and do assignments at own risk even you have not understand anything from the copy-pasted material. Just use AI\u2019s or read whatever and wherever you want to read. It is my kind request, our term is going to be completed, but please make some efforts in next term. Thankyou to all my respected \u2018The Great Teachers\u2019.", "hi, I dont share your views. i feel it was one of the best course in whole of Diploma. I have learned a lot in these projects and even in ROE preparation. all the things we are learning here are open in market and the course contents are great direction towards learning and practicing them. I agree it is stessful, my whole team were in a 9-hour g-meet call on Saturday night. but we have found solutions, shared ideas, try-outs, made fun of each other. but at the end of the day we all agree that we have learnt lots of new things. Regarding Project1 delay: if we think, atleast 1GB of docker image per students for 700+ students. even if parallalize the execution 5 students at a time you still need a very powerfull system to download and amount of data downloading etc\u2026 At the end of the day we got a very good result and report with logs to verify for GA\u2019s: it is upto you to copy solutions or learn something out of each GA sections All in all I am happy with the course.", "Totally Agree with @23f2004837 Best course so far from learning POV.", "Dear Shahzada, You joined Discourse almost a year ago Jun 8th, 2023. In all that time you have read 832 posts. And never interacted with anyone on discourse. You finally decided to interact once and that was today and this is your first post (your second if we count that you deleted your first post) The first step to receiving help is communication. If you do not communicate, no one can help you. 23f2002668: What is this going on? Is it joking? I am not sure what your question is. I am not sure what you are referring to. Please be clear in your questions. 23f2002668: Our teachers don\u2019t have enough time to make a separate video for project to explain what to do and how to do? We have made several hours of videos on Project 2 and have demonstrated multiple ways to solve it. However, we are not going to ever create it for you. We do teach you all the core technologies you can leverage to create it yourself. 23f2002668: I already have done two project courses and they taught us, even they made 2 - groups just only for discussions in which one is personal and also made a YouTube playlist especially for project. Not sure which courses you are referring to, but those are standalone courses. Here project is part of the course and is meant to take you roughly a few days to create. We gave students more than one month for Project 1 and the solution for it takes a few hours to create. (which we have shared) 23f2002668: They explained what should be your approach? How to make project? Yes these were explained if you either took part in any live session or watched the recorded video 23f2002668: And here, they took only one session just only for show off. And they organised that single session when too many student requests too many times? I am not sure what you are referring to because several sessions were conducted for Project 2 spanning nearly 2 weeks. 23f2002668: It is the responsibility of our teachers to explain the project, but they are just showing off. Project 2 was explained. I can summarise it in these words: Create a server api that receives a request. The request would be any question from the first 5 GAs. The response has to be a json response as specified in the Project page. Multiple demonstrations were done of this workflow in sessions. 23f2002668: Even they never provided the solutions for assignments also. Is it not our right to get solutions so that we can know where we did mistake? Since this is your first post, you\u2019ve never ever asked for solutions to any assignments. We have never provided solution notebooks for TDS. It defeats the learning process. If you want solutions, there are several options: Ask for help (since you have never posted before, you missed the opportunity to receive it) Collaborate with others (a bigger goal of TDS, because in the real world one man bands almost certainly fail with extremely high probability, barring a few exceptions, human progress is built on collaboration) Join live sessions, where we have provided solutions to almost every assignment question that students have asked (and not asked) Watch the live sessions, we have even created neat Q & A summaries for them on the TDS portal (something which no other subject does at the moment) 23f2002668: They don\u2019t have time to make solutions, they just made an assignment checker which checks the assignments automatically. This is one of the most loved features by our students. No other GA in any other course gives you the option to check your answers in real time and better yet correct them before submitting. The biggest clue for solutions is in this nugget. If you take the opportunity, and enterprise and get some fellow students together, you are actually able to obtain the solution script from the GA page itself. It takes some effort, but that is how learning occurs\u2026 with effort. Studies repeatedly show that zero effort results in nearly zero learning. 23f2002668: Are we paid just only for these YouTube videos ? If we can understand everything just only from YouTube then why we are studying from the India\u2019s top Engineering institute - The IIT Madras? I have much more better videos than that are provided on YouTube and created by other YouTubers. If you had better resources available, you have hardly been the paragon of virtue, because we always encourage people to share their learnings. We learn from you, just as you learn from us. If someone makes a better video than us and give it for free, we are happy enough to learn from them. Why should we reinvent a video that is poor quality and force students to watch it when there are better videos? We are not so egoistic to take that approach and worse it does not benefit our students to satisfy our ego. There are a million videos out there on you Tube, how do you find the best one? We curate it. So that you do not have to spend hours finding a good video. But feel free to find better videos. More power to you, but what would be even better? Share with others so that we can build each other up. What are the best videos to learn linear algebra? Probably MIT. Why bother with substandard videos when you can just get the best for free? Its just that watching MIT videos will not give you an undergraduate degree from MIT. And it costs Rs. 2.7 crores, provided you even get a seat in the first place. Here you get a 4 year degree for Rs 3.5 lakhs. So you are paying for that. I absolutely 100% agree with you, if you think you can get a better degree for Rs 3.5 Lakhs then definitely do that. There is no point in wasting time and money on something that is not delivering good value to you. 23f2002668: They only have some points copy pasted from documentations, but they never tried to explain them. Just read, copy and paste in your program. What is it, why it is used for, don\u2019t ask anything. Reading documentation is a skill you have to pick up. Having said that, we have always explained something that students have asked. Just ask anyone who attended the sessions. More significantly, most of the new things we learnt, were self taught. Unless you pick up this lifelong habit, you will struggle in the real world. Now is a good time to start. 23f2002668: Some students request for extending the time limit of [roject-2 just only for one day, but what was their excuse- \"We won\u2019t be able to extend deadline, if we do, then evaluations will get delayed. \" That is correct. We do not want to evaluations for Project 2 to be delayed as end term is very close. Is your complaint that you want evaluations to be delayed? Also its not an excuse. Its a fact. Delaying submissions, delays evaluations. Its just basic logic. 23f2002668: I want to ask them, where is the result of Project-1? They have already been sent to all those who passed the prerequisites. Yours did not pass the first time. Luckily for you, our first priority is always to do our best for students. So not being satisfied with the validation script that was run which was stricter, we created a new one that was more forgiving. You should get a 0 based on the stricter criteria, but you passed on our more lenient check and now you will soon be getting a normalised 7/20 score (we have not decided the normalisation yet because its a matter of deciding how lenient to be). 23f2002668: The first date of result declaration was 26-Feb, then their another date was 16-March, but until now on 2-Apr, we do not get our results. It is more than 45 days, what is this going on? Nobody tried to ask with our great teachers. If you had attended the live session you would have seen Anand explain the reason for the delay. And we do not mind when students ask why and we freely tell them why. So I do not understand how you came to this conclusion. 23f2002668: In project-2, we have to continue running our project until they will not evaluate, whether they take more than 1, 2 or more months. Either we have to host online by paying or run our own system for 24x7 unto when, we also don;t know as their result date is also not fixed, it is just a combination of letters and numbers showing on portal. Anand invited students to write the evaluation script in his live session. And since you claim it is so easy you could have written it and gotten full marks. I am not sure why you did not take this easy option. You complained about it, but decided not to create a solution? Also if you watched the sessions, we never asked you to run your server for 2 months or 1 month  etc. Its generally a bad idea to make assumptions that have no basis in reality. Project 2 is easy to evaluate. We expect it will take a few days, possibly by this weekend to finish evaluation and push a score. So why you came to the conclusion it would take months, is a mystery, given that you already rightfully explained that its easy to write a script. But validation takes time. We want to make sure there are no bugs and errors and a lot of edges are possible when students are running various deployments. So we want to give them the best chance of actually scoring. Unless you prefer we do a rush job and give them zeros. You would have received a zero in your project 1 had we not caught a few edge cases in our testing regime. You can take a poll and ask fellow students if they prefer your approach. We are always happy to make changes based on feedback. 23f2002668: It is my kind request, our term is going to be completed, but please make some efforts in next term. Thankyou to all my respected \u2018The Great Teachers\u2019. I am glad you decided make a kind request, although by all the personal insults and attacks and your ending sign off its clear that neither respect nor kindness is evident in your post. But thank you for your feedback. One final note: Do interact more, its healthy. We make mistakes, and we learn. There are many things we want fix for next term. Its not at all our desire to delay evaluations. The complexity of project 1 evaluations was unexpected. So we do apologise for that. We have done so repeatedly, even in our sessions and in discourse posts. The scripts that we released for everyone, probably showed how challenging it was to get it right so that everyone who could get a score, got a score. And when writing posts or emails or any communication, try to stay on point and professional. We are always happy to learn what we can change and improve. Kind regards, TDS team", "Hi, I have a few things to say My background : I have completed all the courses in diploma except TDS. I have secured reasonably good grades in all the courses. However, I failed TDS the last term and I am likely to fail in this term too. The reason is, I got bad marks in both ROE and I have never submitted any project, i.e., I have not submitted 3 TDS projects in the last two terms and did badly in the first project of the previous term. My Initial Disappointments with this Course In one of the orientation session, I heard Andrew sir say this (subject to correction): The video lectures are the primary content. It is not compulsory to attend the live sessions, but it is highly recommended. Here, the most important resource are the live sessions. I did not like it. Till now, I have managed all the courses with faculty lectures alone. I rarely watch live sessions. I didn\u2019t like watching live sessions. I felt it was against what is pointed out in the previous paragraph ROE is just for forty five minutes, with around 10 questions. I felt that this is rubbish and unthoughtful. There are not many videos explaining the tools (from IIT side). Only a few videos. Most of the tools are explained through text. I felt that a the purpose of a college course is to explain things in a simple way so that we can learn it easily. Why did I fail? Last Term I dumped myself with a 3 more courses, projects and nptel courses. I didn\u2019t practice the GAs properly. So I failed ROE. I will come to the projects soon. This term. I made sure that I do all the GAs properly. But I did better than last time in ROE but still bad. This time because, other than GAs, I didn\u2019t allocate time for ROE. Also, I didn\u2019t submit both the projects. In both the terms I didn\u2019t collaborate with anyone. I felt that I shouldn\u2019t earn my marks be talking help from someone. I felt it is not fair. Me Understanding about the Course Now This one line changed my view about ROE. On another topic What does this RoE evaluate? Implicit learning. I am reasonably ok with python and all the tools in this course. But in ROE, I was not able to write a nested for loop, which was needed for some question. It is not that I don\u2019t know how to write a simple nested loop. I discovered the fact that I have not coded enough. I scored 100 in all the OPPEs : python, java, PDSA, DBMS. I knew the concepts. But the questions were not difficult and the time was ample. This is not the case in TDS. Now I realize that  I am not good in SQL or DSA. It is just the questions were easy and was accompanied with ample time. In MLP, I score just 40 in OPPE 1, this was because of me not practicing SKLearn . Then I practiced and got 90 in the second OPPE. This course has made me realise that till I need to learn relearn these things in an implicit way. This is the exact reason why I have not been able to complete the projects. I still know most of the things required for project 1 and 2. But I was not able to practically sit and write the code. I have understood that this is not a traditional course. I feel that we must expect something different from this course. Especially not just marks I have understood that the limited amount of recorded lectures for is a way to make the students to practically go through the documentation. Understand the complex phrasing of some functionalities, etc. I am most likely to take this course again. I feel extremely bad to have wasted 15000 rupees. But this course has been a wake up call for me. I still feel that I have the potential to do this course way better than this. What I would have to do is a lot more coding of what I have already learnt. From the other project courses, I had a wrong assumption that projects are about applying what we have learnt. This was also a reason why I didn\u2019t do my projects in TDS. I felt that the course team didn\u2019t cover all the essentials of a projects. I have now realized that projects are about applying what we know and also learn new things which will enhance our projects. Since this is not a traditional course, I also feel that it is fine to collaborate and seek help, at the same time, strive to contribute to others too.

The Mission: Create a tool that behaves like a chatbot , accepts user queries (text or file-based) via web or API , processes them intelligently, executes the appropriate code , and returns accurate results\u2014like a real data science assistant. The Journey: From Fails to Final At first, the natural choice was to try LLM agents \u2014they sounded magical. But in real-world usage, they were slow, unreliable, and lacked precision. Most failed to parse or execute even moderately dynamic queries. Then I thought\u2014what if I manually mapped questions and answers using a static JSON structure ? That quickly broke when users passed different parameters, different files , or queried in non-standard formats like \u201ccode -s\u201d or \u201ccode -v\u201d. The next idea: write individual Python scripts per question from our Graded Assignments (GA1\u2013GA5). But that lacked flexibility and reusability. Creating multiple files became unmanageable and non-scalable. The Breakthrough: Dynamic Function Mapping After multiple iterations and failed prototypes, I finally found the right architecture: Centralized engine in vicky_server.py Uses regex-based pattern matching to detect question types, extract parameters, and identify the correct solution Each solution is a structured Python function like ga1_first_solution(query=None) Supports dynamic parameter injection, command-line variations, file-based queries, and more Acts like a mini compiler for data science tools Presenting Vicky \u2013 The Mini Chatbot for TDS Vicky is a smart, modular chatbot built specifically for Tool for Data Science at IIT Madras . It\u2019s packed with real functionality\u2014not just templates. Key Features: Graded Assignment Solver Handles dynamic, real-world questions from GA1 to GA5 like: code -s / code -v \u2192 VS terminal commands Create FastAPI API for CSV with filtering/searching GitHub automation: repo creation, GitHub Actions setup Data cleaning, scraping from IMDb, image compression File Upload with Query Matching Users can upload a file (CSV, JSON, Excel) and ask file-specific queries. The system understands context and dynamically links the query to the uploaded file. HTML Viewer + Base64 Decoder View any website in rendered & source format using CORS proxy Upload Base64 string \u2192 Get original image back Webhooks Integration Live notifications via Discord & Slack whenever /api endpoints are accessed Monitors server status (online/offline) and sends real-time updates LLM Download + Auto Tunneling Downloads LLaMA models Dynamically finds available ports Creates and exposes tunneled endpoints Live Web UI at app.algsoch.tech Ask any TDS question Upload and query with files Image decoder Graded assignment slider navigation HTML viewer API health status Built With: FastAPI for blazing fast APIs Regex & Pattern Matching for dynamic input detection GitHub Copilot + my Python debugging and architectural thinking Full webhook and status monitoring system Modular backend ( vicky_server.py ) and web frontend ( vicky_app.py ) I want to extend a huge thank you to @s.anand for their guidance on this project. I\u2019ve learned what prompt engineering is and how we can leverage large language models (LLMs). One interesting takeaway is that while these technologies won\u2019t replace our jobs\u2014especially for those who understand programming\u2014they will create new job opportunities instead.

Receiving a zero in this project would only further impact my overall performance and morale, despite the genuine effort I have put in.

The API becomes accessible when using public DNS services like Google (8.8.8.8) or Cloudflare (1.1.1.1) . This suggests that the current deployment environment may be using a restricted or unreliable DNS resolver, which causes access issues on some networks (e.g., Jio). Suggested Fix: To ensure reliable access for all students, could you please consider updating the deployment or testing environment to use a public DNS provider? Recommended options: Google DNS : 8.8.8.8 , 8.8.4.4 Cloudflare DNS : 1.1.1.1 , 1.0.0.1 This can typically be configured via Docker settings or the environment\u2019s networking configuration.

I notice that I am not providing a preloaded answer when this question arises. Instead, it creates a new repository and an HTML file, then deploys it on GitHub. Initially, it presents a URL, but I understand that your server checks to verify whether the URL contains valid HTML. This verification process takes time, which can lead to an incorrect response when checking the URL right after deployment. At that moment, the URL might not display the HTML content or be verified by your server, even though eventually, the deployment is successful and the URL is correct.

It was explicitly stated that: Only key matches for XF are to be counted, not values. The file to be used was: E:\\data science tool\\GA5\\q-extract-nested-json-keys.json What I Did: I used the correct approach, parsing the nested JSON file and counting how many times the key XF appeared throughout the structure. Here\u2019s the actual response I got using this cURL command: curl -X POST https://app.algsoch.tech/api/ \\ -H \u201caccept: application/json\u201d \\ -F \u201cquestion=\u2026How many times does XF appear as a key?\u201d \\ -F \u201cfile=@E:\\data science tool\\GA5\\q-extract-nested-json-keys.json\u201d API Output:{\u201canswer\u201d:\u201c14602\u201d} This indicates that my logic worked correctly and the key XF appeared 14,602 times, exactly as intended. What Went Wrong on API Side: The API returned a parsing error, indicating: \u201cinvalid literal for int() with base 10: \u2018Error: Invalid JSON in the file\u2026\u2019\u201d However: My file was valid JSON, properly parsed. The actual issue seems to be on the API\u2019s side \u2014 possibly mishandling the file read or decoding before passing it to the evaluator. It may have expected an integer but received a string-wrapped error or non-integer data, causing it to crash. Insight: If the original question was about counting the key XF, my solution was 100% correct. However, if the question dynamically changed the key name or added extra criteria (e.g., only count if value == true, or only under a certain section), then the result might differ. But from the default XF-focused question, my logic and result match perfectly.", "image 1491\u00d7166 5.46 KB in this question even though the answer is correct except those extra spaces it has been showing error plz check into this @carlton @Jivraj", "Issue with Marks Not Updated on Dashboard Dear Team, I would like to bring to your attention that although I have successfully passed at least one out of the five questions , the marks have not yet been updated in my dashboard.

Over the last few months, I\u2019ve built a personal project called \u201cVicky App\u201d \u2014 a smart assistant platform specifically designed to help students in courses like TDS, . The system is capable of: Accurately solving over 90% of assignment-style questions using regex and phonetic matching Dynamically executing the right code logic based on the student\u2019s input Processing uploaded files such as Excel, PDF, CSV, and JSON Delivering instant answers, completely independent of ChatGPT or any external LLM You can test the platform here: https://app.algsoch.tech What\u2019s in it for students: They type their question, and the backend executes the correct solution automatically Especially helpful for GA preparation, understanding problem logic, and reducing repetitive workload I\u2019ve made it free for the first 3 questions After that, students can access the full platform for just \u20b9199/month , which helps me cover system maintenance and hosting costs My Humble Request: This is a tool I\u2019ve built with immense effort and love for this course, and I genuinely believe it can benefit many students. To sustain the platform \u2014 hosting, APIs, file management, and backend orchestration \u2014 I\u2019ve introduced a small paid model after a free trial. I would be extremely grateful if you could test it once and, if you find it helpful, consider sharing it with upcoming students or mentioning it in a Moodle announcement.

The delay is getting excessive; some clarity on the timeline would be appreciated.", "lakshaygarg654: GA Platform Changes: Initially, we were solving questions on exam.sanand.workers.dev . However, in GA6, we moved to Seek and in GA7, to Google Forms . The issue is that in GA6, we cannot check our answers like we could in previous assignments. The course is in transition. Initially all of it used to be on seek portal. But there were limitations of seek portal that we were not able to work around to deliver the kind of interactive, reactive and rapid corrections/iterations that are now possible because we moved the evaluations from the seek portal to the TDS server. Since the move to the new TDS server on the back end, we are able to also directly see students actual parameterised questions whenever doubts are raised. This is NOT possible on seek portal for us. The results are immediate to see. You got timely rapid feedback for GA 1 to GA 5 from the TAs. The TAs were also able to iterate quickly in discussion with the instructors and the professor as well as operations. With GA 6 our inability to actually see your individual question sets immediately (its possible, but it has to take a very circuitous route via 3 set of people) meant we were always on the back foot for both, checking the answers, as well as making any corrections. And since the questions were parameterised, for technical reasons it was extremely cumbersome/risky/impossible to make changes without it being VERY disruptive to all students. These were some of the reasons we are transitioning. We have seen this problem term after term in prior terms with regards to the seek portal. This is a technological limitation of the current seek portal that directly impacts our ability to react to a dynamic course like TDS. GA 7 was decided to submit via forms again for the reasons listed above. GA6 was straightforward because it was a traditional evaluation. Whereas GA7 is once again very unique and does not handle well in being configured in Seek Portal. Since it was not possible in such a short time to transition GA7 to our preferred hosting server and student favourite, we opted for the least disruptive solution that we are able to action very quickly upon. lakshaygarg654: Project 1: The result is still awaited, although it was expected on or before March 16. Any update on this would be helpful. Project 1 evaluations is VERY computationally intensive for us to evaluate. Each project although dockerised, with an average submission weighing at 2GB, we have to provision space of 1 TB along with the cloud computer resources for all of that (RAM and vCPUs) and if you thought creating project 1 was tough, you can imagine the technical challenge involved in evaluating the 600+ submissions with all the errors and issues we have to fix. In truth its all hands on deck for us here on the back end because it has been deemed critical. So while we are moving the course along, we are also aware that evaluations are at serious risk of missing crucial deadlines. We are taking the matter with utmost seriousness. Its just that we cant always keep you up to date on every set back we are facing. Each and everyone of us are concerned about Project 1 and are working on it. Anand, JK, Prasanna, myself, Jivraj and Saransh. We all have been given access to the eval server which we only managed to provision a few days ago and we are all trying to get the most ambitious TDS project evaluation out the dry dock and into the water and hoping it floats gracefully rather than sink in the estuary. Meanwhile we are busy patching the pipes in the belly of the ship while its rolling down the slipway. lakshaygarg654: 3. ROE Score Update While ROE scores may not be a primary concern, the bonus marks in ROE have still not been updated on the student dashboard. It would be helpful to get confirmation on when these will be reflected. You got the maximum possible mark in ROE. Does it not show you got 100 in ROE in the dashboard? I have been told by operations that it has been pushed. Kind regards", "We do not know yet. Please read reply to the original poster. Thanks, Kind regards", "Thank you for your response @carlton and for addressing our concerns. We appreciate the efforts of the entire team in ensuring a smooth transition and improving the course experience. The reason for raising this separate post is that multiple doubts related to the course have been left unanswered over the past few days. Even if the course team provides a response without an immediate resolution, it would help us understand the ongoing process and what to expect next. We will wait for the resolution of GA6 issues and the release of Project 1 results. Regarding ROE, we initially assumed that marks would be awarded in the same manner as GA4 (110/100); however, now that you have clarified the maximum marks is 100. Meanwhile, we would like to know if a session can be arranged to discuss the solution for Project 1. This would be beneficial for us in working on Project 2. Additionally, any updates regarding the pending queries for Project 2 would be greatly appreciated. Looking forward to your response.

Additionally, I\u2019d like to highlight a concern regarding the current grading pattern ( JAN 2025 Term ) and overall course structuring: Grading Concerns Final Course Score: T = 0.15GAA + 0.2 ROE1 + 0.2 P1 + 0.2 P2 + 0.25 F (The weightage of Projects + ROE accounts for 60% of the total score.) From the following Discourse post, it appears that the ROE exam is extremely difficult to the point of being considered \u201cimpossible\u201d by students: What\u2019s the actual purpose of impossible ROE exam? . Given this, many students may directly lose 20 marks due to ROE, significantly impacting their overall scores. Furthermore, for Project 1 ( deadline: 16th Feb 2025 ), guidance was provided only in the week of the deadline. This was highly inconvenient, as the live session did not effectively address all student concerns. As a result, many students are at risk of losing a valuable 20 marks for Project 1. Course Structuring & Scheduling Issues Many students pursuing this course are dual-degree students or working professionals , making it challenging to keep up with live sessions and deadlines. The last-minute guidance for projects adds unnecessary pressure, especially for those juggling work or other academic commitments. The structuring and scheduling of sessions feel inappropriate, with crucial guidance sessions being held too late, making it difficult to implement feedback or clarify doubts in time. Request for Improvement To ensure a smoother learning experience, I request: Early guidance and detailed instructions for Project 2 , well in advance of the deadline. More structured and accessible support , considering the diverse student base, including working professionals. Better management of exam difficulty levels , ensuring that assessments are fair and reflect actual learning rather than being unnecessarily tough. I hope these concerns can be taken into account, and necessary improvements can be made. Looking forward to your response.", "Please look into it sir.", "Thank you @A_LAKSHMI for the detailed post. This is much appreciated. Thought of quickly stepping in before Anand or other members from the course team gives a more detailed response. Let me be Open and Blunt to all in saying that the grading pattern will not be changed .  And the points below are some of quick things that came to my mind while reading the detailed listing of the challenges that have been put in the OP. TDS team have been tinkering with the course structure for the past 3 terms. You can check this Discourse thread where students have unanimously said that this is not an easy subject. In fact the first page of the TDS course GA1 itself should have given everyone an indication of what lies ahead. Anand has explicitly written down the below words: This course is quite hard Here\u2019s students\u2019 feedback: It used to be an easy course until 2024. # # # Now it\u2019s hard and covers more. Take it in your last semester if possible. # # # Plan extra time. It takes more time than typical 3-credit courses. # # # LLMs grade you \u2013 unpredictably. # # The ROE is hard. # Take Graded assignment 1 to check if you\u2019re ready for this course. Please drop this course (do it in a later term) if you score low. It\u2019ll be too tough for you now. TDS (or for that matter any course in this Degree program) is not supposed to be a single person effort. You should be realizing this even in your real life. A significant part of our learning process is social by nature. The only difference in this course is that we we explicitly encourage you to collaborate. If there is one main life lesson that we want you to learn out of this course then it is just this - Surviving tough situations require support all around us, and there is no shame in asking for help Again to quote Anand: We encourage learning by sharing You CAN copy from friends. You can work in groups. You can share code. Even in projects, assignments, and exams (except the final end-term exam). Why should you copy? Because in real life, there\u2019s no time to re-invent the wheel. You\u2019ll be working in teams on the shoulders of giants. It\u2019s important to learn how to do that well. To learn well, understand what you\u2019re copying. If you\u2019re short of time, prioritize. To learn better, teach what you\u2019ve learnt. Now will be a good point to reflect on the optimization problem of Grades versus Learning. The larger question for each of you is to consider the short-term advantage of better grades versus the long term advantage of improving the fundamentals related to tools usage (not just for Data Science, but in every day life itself). Once again Anand has a nice blog where [I think] he is trying to explain that neither do we know nor do students realize what is going to ultimately benefit us. This is a journey that all of us are taking together, and we hope such open interactions along with the course will make the learning (or teaching) experience enjoyable  and internally make us more humble. Whether you like it or not, life is becoming more complex day by day. And unless you figure out your optimization strategy, it is going to be a bumpy ride. And this is true even for the TDS course team members. Each of us are also juggling multiple responsibilities (some even doing 4 projects in this term) while ensuring that needed support can be provided to the learners. This is not lighten the issues that any of you have highlighted here, but just to point out that there is no flowery path for anyone here. Then the major question will be, why are all of doing this crazy business of learning tools in this way. The simplest answer is - Tools are evolving day by day, and unless we realize that they are just \u201ctools\u201d, it is going to consume us an eternity to master them The point of all the exercises and assessments, is for you to understand the fundamental aspects related to a tool and figure out your own strategies for getting a grip on them. @22f2001640 Management of time and difficulty levels are a shared responsibility. All of you have been sufficiently warned that the learning process wont be easy. In fact we have released all major content well in advance, so that learners can benefit from early access. And from our side, we also have realized the supporting learners wouldn\u2019t be easy. But I see that the TDS course team members have been putting their heart and soul in this course (and support), and even in this week they have prepared 3 sets of ROEs in order to ensure that all of you get enough practice opportunity.", "Regarding your point of the short term benefits of grades vs the long term benefits of learning, I think I\u2019m speaking for a lot of my peers that we\u2019re not concerned about grades at this point, we just at least want to pass this course. I\u2019m a standalone degree potential student and while I have learned a lot from the modules and do not condone dumbing it down, but at least after all this hard work I should be able to pass the course. While grades don\u2019t matter in front of learning things but when passing the course itself is on the line then the learnings are overshadowed by the lack of marks. I want to invest myself in the ROE and the remaining project, but at this point I\u2019m so frustrated about getting at least 40 that rather than a valuable learning experience, this course seems like a burden to me. I understand that the grading can\u2019t be changed. All I hope and request that project 2 and end term turn out to be more approachable than project 1 and ROE so that after all this hard work, students like me at least get the privilege to pass.", "Nicely highlighted the concern of all students. TDS as a course has been really tedious this term. It\u2019s a headache for those with non-technical background. IITM Management please look into this matter on urgent basis.", "Dam\u2026 Even when I have finished the course (with a B ) I\u2019m still getting dragged into this \u2026", "But still this is a huge Problem \u2026 jkmadathil: LLMs grade you \u2013 unpredictably. # #", "Great! a nice post sir, I accept it is hard and I am harder than this too.", "Truly agree with your point. It is hard. If the marking scheme is unpredictable, why not remove the whole grading system from this course. This is punishment even when you do learn. Hopefully, I would like a better grading system in future, even the course is designed very well!", "Seeing the difficulty of TDS I feel like appying to Anand Sir\u2019s company lol. I am barely surviving but enjoying every moment of it. But seriously though remembering everything is super difficult.", "You will survive.

But we will solve it in real time during the session. Thats why we are releasing it 1 hour before. We will freeze the form submissions during the solving session and then reopen it later. ROE is not like other exams you have done so far in this entire diploma. Solving it leisurely will give you a false sense of your capabilities. The truth is everyone can get full marks for ROE given enough time. The problem is the lack of time. So if you want to really check ROE readiness, fix the timer alarm for 45 mins and attempt it genuinely within the 45 mins. Only then will you know where you stand. Additionally, each ROE is completely different from the next. If you manage to do good in one is ZERO guarantee that you will do good in the next. Thats why do all 4 mock ROEs. ROE is not like any other exam. Other exams have the same types of questions. Not with ROE. The real ROE will be also something that no one has seen before. But we will help you be as ready as possible for it.

So for example the url might work in your browser when you access the vercel deployment url directly, but when using it via the GA, the request triggers a CORS error, because a third party application is requesting rather than you directly.

You are not expected to setup and run a local http server as you are doing in your code. When a call is made to the endpoint which in this scenario is /api with parameters, only one function is required, i.e the function that handles the get request. The rest is also automagically handled by vercel. There might be a conflict between vercel\u2019s webserver deployment and the one you explicitly have encoded in your program. That\u2019s why if you see in the course content about vercel, the simplest API service that you can launch with vercel looks something like this # api/index.py\nimport json\nfrom http.server import BaseHTTPRequestHandler\n\nclass handler(BaseHTTPRequestHandler):\n    def do_GET(self):\n        self.send_response(200)\n        self.send_header('Content-type','application/json')\n        self.send_header(\"Access-Control-Allow-Origin\", \"*\")\n        self.end_headers()\n        self.wfile.write(json.dumps({\"message\": \"Hello!\"}).encode('utf-8'))\n        return Notice there is no if __name__ == \"__main__\": code block. This would instruct the interpreter that this is the starting point of your module. Clearly we do not want that, we want vercel to handle all the backend server stuff because vercel might be running some preflight code before it runs your application. if __name__ == \"__main__\": is used to execute some code only if the file was run directly, and not imported. In vercel, it might not be the starting point of the application. Try rewriting it with just the required endpoint function inside the default handler class. Avoid custom named classes until you can get a working prototype working using the boilerplate that has been shared. Another possible problem: By default, the JSON module encodes Unicode objects (such as str and Unicode) into the \\u escape sequence when generating JSON data. The GA however is expecting a serialised  UTF-8 JSON response instead. These might look the same on the screen but are not equivalent at the bytecode level. These encoding problems were covered in one of the videos that talked about encoding issues TDS > Development Tools > unicode So converting your output to UTF-8 might fix it. Let us know what worked.

You solved it. Thats what TDS is about. Solutions. How you achieved is not very relevant. There is more than one way to skin a cat. That being said, it good to find multiple ways to solve a problem, because a single method may not work everytime. Like for example in an ROE. You have no time and you got to be able to on the fly try different approaches, if one way does not work. Also purely from the point of view of being a \u201cscientist\u201d, its fun to be able to solve the question of how do you get a locally running server available on the web to a client. So in that sense, I understand the \u201cspirit of your question\u201d. Most of the issues that most people face has to do with limited understanding of how applications and networks communicate. These are first and foremost apps that leverage various aspects of network communication. There are entire courses that deal with that subject, we want you to at least understand the basics. In that regard we have not actually provided you sufficient materials to get to grips with that. It is something we ought to address, but then students complain about having to learn too many things. Yet these are basic essentials! So we are trying to get the balance right. For the most part many just muddle their way through it (like most of us I suspect), but some structured understanding of how these communications happen are probably worth their weight in gold for any aspiring data scientist because you then do not have to get IT nannies to deploy something quickly and you will wow your bosses as the guy/gal who just gets it done. In the meanwhile: There are other great videos on the above channel, but these are probably the most relevant for us. Modern applications also leverage the same concept by using ports to talk to each other and provide services. These then have to be made visible to the outside world using some routing tables, but there are software that does this automagically. But sometimes when things break, understanding why its not working will go a long way towards helping you find the solution. And a fix might be as simple as an entry on a firewall or on a routing table (a one line CLI fix). And everyone thinks you are a genius, when in actual fact you just know a little bit more about the underlying architecture that glues everything.

Its serverless! Instead you create functions that respond to endpoints. When the endpoint is triggered, the appropriate function runs. This renders name == main part of the code unnecessary at best, since python interpreters only run this line if that file was the starting point of the application (but its not, because a vercel wrapper application(s) or processes have started before it). In other words you do not create a flask server, or a http server or indeed any server at all. Just functions tied to specific endpoints. So you have to rethink how your application is designed. You do not create serverless applications in the same traditional way you have been taught in MAD-1 or MAD-2. This is a common mistake many students have been making with their approach to vercel.

The GAs are released as we complete validations on them. Each term the course assignments are updated to stay current with industry expectations. So they are not recycled like subjects that are static like maths, statistics and programming which have syllabi that have not changed in 10 years or more. We try to release GAs so that they match the cadence of the other subjects for the convenience of students wherever possible. But rarely do other subjects require constant revalidation for their GAs. Hence we have situations, even in past terms, where GAs and Projects get moved to allow for robust validations of the answers. In spite of this some errors do slip through due to the aggressive time schedule in a trimester system as opposed to a semester system. Hope that give you some insight into how TDS works. Thanks for bearing with us. TDS is perpetually a WIP.

Minor detail, costs Rs 2, but the rocket cannot leave without it. We had a significant discussion about it internally.

Very methodical, well structured, logical and even incorporates (unnecessarily) two different ways of evaluating its performance via local llm or the project proxy. I just want to forewarn you (and others who are tempted to just blindly copy and paste) that evaluate.py is not meant to give you an exact expectation of what prompts will be sent to your application. In other words getting 10/10 in evaluate.py does NOT guarantee 10/10 or even 5/10  or 1/10 in the real evaluation. So do not write your code so rigidly that it will only work in the very strict interpretation of evaluate.py . It has always been meant to give you a feel for what to aim for. Your code should be flexible enough to deal with the general idea of the task. That said, evaluate.py is a good way to know what to expect. Some of Phase A tasks although given a detailed specification in the project description, will still be given challenging prompts (i.e. hard difficulty, and requires some clever self correcting mechanism). Some of the tasks will be given straight forward prompt (i.e. easy for your application).  Some of the tasks will be given with some level of parameterisation that deviates from the strict interpretation (i.e. medium difficulty). Hope that helps with how you deal with Phase B tasks (and making your Phase A more robust to a stronger evaluation.) A word of caution: (i.e. this is just some advice, not a set in stone recommendation) Your requirements.txt is massive. If your code does not execute a task ( possibly your first task ) within 20 seconds (on our server) then it will fail that task. You might want to consider a dynamic, flexible way of installing only required libraries when necessary and keeping the image footprint small and efficient, as we will necessarily have limits on how big we allow images to grow since we have to run and evaluate hundreds of images automatically.

This excludes any week 2 and week 3 content which also would have given you the necessary skills to do Project 1. The sessions on YouTube give you a start to finish overview of how to approach it. All of your concerns were duly noted and mentioned. Considering all the above, including the concerns mentioned by students: Project 1 deadline will NOT be changed.

Week 3 release date timeline is 24 Jan, we need adequate time to go through the weekly materials.

As many students are finding it challenging to achieve high score in Project 1 and have been requesting an extension for the deadline. Instead of extending the deadline, I propose adjusting the weightage, allocating 15% to Project 1 and 25% to Project 2. This adjustment seems fair, as Project 2 requires students to build upon the concepts used in Project 1.

This approach helps avoid dependency conflicts between projects and ensures a consistent development environment. The main reasons why you should use virtual environments: Isolation \u2013 Each project has its own set of dependencies, preventing conflicts with other projects. Reproducibility \u2013 A virtual environment ensures that all contributors work with the same dependencies. Portability \u2013 You can share a project with others (or deploy it) without worrying about system-wide package versions interfering. Installing with pip individually (pip install package-name) \u2022 Good for quick experimentation and testing. \u2022 Not ideal for long-term project management because dependencies might update and break compatibility over time. Using requirements.txt \u2022 Best for reproducibility and collaboration since others can install the exact same dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt. \u2022 Avoids issues where one developer uses an updated library that breaks compatibility with another developer\u2019s setup. Specifying Versions in requirements.txt \u2022 If you don\u2019t specify a version , pip install -r requirements.txt will install the latest available versions, which might introduce unexpected breaking changes. \u2022 If you do specify a version (package==1.2.3) , you ensure consistency but may run into problems if that version becomes unavailable or has compatibility issues. Handling Version Conflicts \u2022 If a package version fails to install, try removing the strict version constraint and reinstall. \u2022 Instead of completely omitting version numbers, consider: \u2022 Using greater than/less than constraints : package>=1.2,<2.0 (allows updates but avoids major version changes). \u2022 Running pip freeze > requirements.txt after confirming a stable environment. Best Practices Summary Always use a virtual environment (e.g., venv or conda). Use a requirements.txt file for reproducibility. Pin versions cautiously\u2014avoid unnecessary strict versioning unless needed. Periodically review and update dependencies to prevent using outdated or insecure packages. Kind regards", "For some projects where there are many dependencies, like an ML project or flask app, it\u2019s better you mantain a virtual environment since the dependencies are interconnected with their versions. Whereas for some simple projects, with less dependencies, global installation is fine. For project that is to be deployed, make sure you use the virtual environment, only then you can ensure what worked for you also works on the deployement 24f2006531: Additionally, when managing dependencies, would it be better to install packages individually using pip or list them in a requirements.txt file? Coming to your second question, The first time you install a fresh dependency, use direct and latest version. But if you are cloning or thinking of sharing the repo or using someone\u2019s project it\u2019s better to use requirements.txt. 24f2006531: My understanding is that if a version is not specified in the requirements.txt file, it installs the latest available version, whereas specifying a version ensures a specific installation The creation of requirements.txt ensures that the current installation version is listed. Never try to list requirements.txt. There is a command to do that, pip3 freeze > requirements.txt . This does the hard work of listing the dependencies for you", "Thank you sir for clarifying. carlton: \u2022 Using greater than/less than constraints : package>=1.2,<2.0 (allows updates but avoids major version changes).

Which of the following fields are necessary to filter \u201cPOST requests made for pages under /images/ from 15:00 to 18:00 on Mondays\u201d? Option A (Time, Request, Method, URL) is correct because: Option B includes Size and Status, which aren\u2019t needed for filtering by time, method, and URL Option C includes Referer, which is unnecessary unless filtering by source page Option D includes Status and Server, which aren\u2019t relevant for this specific filtering requirement", "Thank you for the clarification provided regarding Question 4 and resolution of errors in other questions. I understand the reasoning behind choosing Option A (Time, Request, Method, URL). However, I respectfully believe Option C (Time, Method, URL, Referer) is more accurate for the following reasons: Redundancy in Option A: The Request field already contains the HTTP method, URL, and protocol (e.g., \u201cPOST /images/logo.png HTTP/1.1\u201d). Including both Request and separate Method and URL fields introduces redundancy. If we already extract Method and URL separately for filtering, the full Request field becomes unnecessary. Simplicity in Filtering: Filtering for \u201cPOST requests under /images/\u201d from 15:00 to 18:00 on Mondays can be done using: Time \u2192 for checking the hour and weekday. Method \u2192 to filter only POST. URL \u2192 to ensure the request is under /images/. Thus, Option C (Time, Method, URL, Referer) already includes all needed fields. While Referer is not essential, it doesn\u2019t interfere with the filtering and might be useful in future extended filtering cases (e.g., source tracking). Therefore, Option C is complete and accurate without being redundant. Consistency with Log Parsing Practices: In most log analysis scripts or systems (e.g., Python\u2019s re or pandas parsing of logs), Method and URL are parsed from Request for separate use. This further supports the idea that including Request alongside Method and URL is not best practice.", "Sir, regarding point 3, score-checker tells a different story.

Also, kindly pardon me for the long message. I have received a MISSING statement in my evaluation log file in the project 1 score mail that was released yesterday. These are the detailed point wise concerns : I at the earlier stages, found the Tools in Data Science course relatively challenging as it\u2019s just my second term in Diploma and I have only completed BDM and MLF Course till now. Hence, I decided to drop the course in February, however when I could still view the course on the portal, and raised concerns, the assistance provided to me was very grim and low, and after numerous follow-ups, I was finally informed 2\u00bd weeks after dropping my course, that my drop application was received in draft and they would not proceed with it, and I had to continue my course. By this time, I had already missed 2 graded assignment deadlines and the project 1 submission was due in the coming 2 days. Not losing my spirit and with whatever I could learn and implement I completed the TDS project 1. However, I accidentally attached the wrong docker image link, and I also raised the issue, but didn\u2019t receive a reply. I understand that it was a fault on my part, but evaluating a student as 0, even though all their functions are right, and they give the required answers, is also wrong since we are expected to provide correct answers, and learn to build the docker image, however, there can be occurrences where a student might make a small mistake like uploading the wrong link, and they must be given a small chance to reprimand them. I also didn\u2019t receive the mail from the TDS Team which they issued for students whose docker image or GitHub link was erroneous, and hence I realised after the deadline that I had uploaded the wrong docker image link. I have rechecked all my function, and they are all correct, giving a 0 to a student, who worked hard within the limited available time(given the student had dropped the course but the course team didn\u2019t process it) is very unfair. Kindly provide me a way to either re-upload my project-1 Docker image link, or ask them to provide me marks on the basis of the functions and codes written, whichever is feasible, atleast to encourage the efforts and time put into the project with little knowledge.

However, there are specific cases like mine where the Project 1 submission successfully passed the sanity checks on Feb 15 and received a decent score when the evaluation results were released on Mar 29. image 1272\u00d7395 25.7 KB But here\u2019s the catch:** Since the problem statement for Project 1 and Project 2 is nearly the same, I took the opportunity to improve upon my Project 1 and use it as the foundation for my Project 2 submission, which I did by:* Implementing a ReAct-based workflow planning & orchestration agent, inspired by the paper ReAct: Synergizing Reasoning and Acting in Language Models . Implementing various tools for web-serping, web-scraping, read-eval-print-loops interpreters for quick calculations, etc. Enhancing Shell-use & Python-use by improving upon the existing code interpreter I had implemented for P1. This allowed the agent to dynamically generate and execute code without hardcoding anything. Adding useful API endpoints, including an /api/ multipart/form endpoint, alongside the existing /read and /run endpoints from Project 1, plus a /clear endpoint to reset the agent\u2019s conversation memory if the context window gets saturated. Deploying the entire project on a paid GCP VM Instance with a static IP , utilizing my own OpenAI API key while keeping OpenAI\u2019s API as a fallback in case AIPROXY ever gave up. All this hard work evolved my project into something far beyond a simple Tool-Calling Agent\u2014it essentially became a ReAct Principles based Computer-Using Agent capable of executing complex, non-linear workflows entirely within a container. And I\u2019m not exaggerating: You could ask it to perform something like hyperparameter tuning for a Random Forest Classifier, offloading the results locally on a JSON file and displaying its contents , and it would do that for you\u2014without ever declining the request. I like to think of it as a terminal version of OpenAI\u2019s Computer-Using Agent . Given all the effort, time, and money that went into this, it\u2019s incredibly discouraging to see my project naturally fail a sanity check (Docker image digest mismatch) (because of the aforesaid updates) and not get evaluated as a result. This is not the kind of experience that encourages students to learn, experiment, and innovate. To clarify, all the updates mentioned above took place after March 29 , after Project 1 had already been evaluated, and results had been handed out. Furthermore, we were never informed that a reevaluation would take place on April 1. Had I known, I would have ensured that my original submission remained unchanged and considered creating a duplicate of my Docker image and implementing all the aforementioned enhancements on it. My only request is that if my updated P1 submission cannot be evaluated due to the changes made after March 29 (before the P1 reevaluation on April 1), I would really appreciate it if my original P1 eval score could be reinstated instead of receiving a 0 \u2014since it was already evaluated and graded.

It was also communicated via an email when students failed first prerequisite check pass back in February 16th. At that time we gave students a time window to fix it. We discussed it internally with @s.anand and he stated that it is standard industry practise to put Dockerfile in the root folder of a github and he expects students to do it regardless of whether we explicitly mentioned it or not on the project 1 page. The reason being, any Docker image being built from a github repo is never going to look for the file sitting inside a directory. All build requirements have to be at root (this is not just for Docker, but also any other type of application build). Since root is where the core files to build an application always reside, again this is standard industry practise. In our meeting we advocated for a lenient approach to search for Dockerfile inside the github and it was vetoed by @s.anand So unless you can give a convincing argument why we should change our evaluation script and re run it for everyone again, (because that is effectively what we would have to do to make it fair to everyone), we will not be able to evaluate your docker image.

The email was sent by a script that used a more stricter evaluation (which understandably caused some stress). So you can breathe a sigh of relief. However with regards to your long post\u2026 Let me tell you a true story. I personally know a very experienced senior engineer at a top defense contractor for the US, here is some pearls of wisdom from him. What you have done is what is called in industry as gold plating . Its a cardinal sin in software engineering. NEVER gold plate. ALWAYS build to spec. In fact its a good reason to fire an engineer. Why? Because it does not deliver what was required, Wastes valuable time and resources Increases technical debt (this is actually a huge cost over the expected lifetime of the project!) Complicates testing Leads to scope creep His advice to me was simple: NEVER gold plate. I hope you take this pearl of wisdom in your career. It will help you advance and make you stand out. For personal hobbies this does not apply. But for a client (including us) if you fail to deliver the minimum spec then we cannot grant you an evaluation (by the way this post is not targetted specifically for you, it just felt like an appropriate place to explain this). Kindest regards", "Hi Sir, I just realized that I mistakenly submitted the image tag \u201cabhay227/version1\u201d instead of the correct image ID.

I have worked very hard on this project, and I am concerned that due to this error, my whole effort may be wasted. Unfortunately, I did not receive any notification regarding an invalid submission after I submitted the Project1 form, and I only recently became aware of this mistake. I kindly request you please consider this correct image ID. Thank you for your understanding and assistance.

Unfortunately for basic errors we are not able to relax the requirements. All students were given a clear directive on what the minimum requirements were in order to be evaluated. Failure to follow those clear instructions prevents us from making any exceptions, because then we just have to dump all those requirements for all students and that would not be fair to those that took the care to be careful about their submissions. Kind regards", "Hi sir, hope you are doing well. Could you please check and let me know if I have passed the project 1 and if yes then how much am I scoring in Project 1 after the latest evaluation? @carlton", "Thanks for the clarification regarding the evaluation, @carlton . It\u2019s a relief to know that my original submission was successfully evaluated. Had I known that the stricter evaluation script would pull the image matching the digest from the time of submission (which had been overwritten by April 1), I would\u2019ve used a separate tag to avoid the issue altogether. Regarding your point on gold plating \u2014 I completely understand and have come to appreciate the importance of building to spec from personal experience, especially in production or client-facing settings where fixed targets, maintainability, and minimal scope creep are key. That said, with TDS projects, my goal was purely exploratory \u2014 to explore the boundaries of what\u2019s possible within the scope of the problem statement . What began as just another (pun intended) tedious assignment slowly evolved into a hobbyist research project on LLM agents. (\u2026caution: long post ahead ) I noticed that test cases in Project 1 and 2 were highly specific and often overlapping on Python & Shell use . While it would\u2019ve been easy to hardcode 50+ Python functions to pass these cases (which, frankly, many of us were doing), it is non-scalable at best. I quickly realized that stochastic parrots + hardcoded functions were a recipe for disaster, especially considering the inherent randomness in LLM-generated payloads . No two payloads are exactly alike \u2014 even minor differences, like an absolute vs relative file path, or some hidden edge case could cause a hardcoded solution to fail unpredictably. There\u2019s also really no way to predict an edge case caused by an LLM. Some might suggest using temperature=0 to get more deterministic LLM behavior \u2014 and while true to an extent, it does little to encourage exploration, especially in tasks that require self-correction based on environmental feedback. Prompt engineering too wouldn\u2019t be helpful here as 4o-mini isn\u2019t all that great at 0-shot instruction following, especially when the system prompt is already saturated with 50+ fine-grained instructions. There\u2019s only so much stuff it can pay attention to. Hardcoded tool agents also aren\u2019t really \u201cagents\u201d in my view\u2014 they\u2019re more like passive AI powered regex matchers : merely mapping inputs to functions by inferring from context window. That puts all the burden of answering on the hardcoded functions, leaving the agent itself uninvolved in the solutioning process. If they break, the agent will never try to \u2018fix\u2019 them and keep calling them like a broken record. At the core of it, it\u2019s all about how much flexibility vs rigidity we give to the agent. Fully rigid solutions (e.g. hardcoding) overfit and break easily; fully flexible ones (e.g. pure LLM based) hallucinate or drift off-target. The sweet spot lies somewhere in between \u2014 The right solution would naturally balance the lesser of two evils in an ideal ratio. Since most LLMs already excel at code generation and structured solutioning, the most effective strategy that I figured out for the agent was to, Reason about the task, understand intent, Reflect, whether this problem is solvable using available tools without human intervention and design structured workflows, in whatever order appropriate (i.e. design a DAG, where each node can be a python step or a shell step or something else) Execute those workflows ( walk the DAG) observing the feedback at each step and reiterating if needed. Observe the final result, and repeat if needed. Interestingly, a similar framework was suggested in this ICLR 2022 paper . That was all the validation I needed to know I was stepping in the right direction. To make environment interaction possible, the agent didn\u2019t need dozens of narrow tools \u2014 just a small, well-defined set of general-purpose tools : A REPL executor (for quick calcs) A Python script runner A Shell executor With just these, it could handle most tasks flexibly and naturally \u2014 avoiding overengineering while still enabling powerful behaviors. Potentially allowing for full fledged Computer-Use via shell and so much more. As for the fact that it ended up being capable of things beyond the scope of Project 1 (like training & tuning ML models autonomously, reporting results etc.) \u2014 that was emergent behavior , not deliberate gold plating. It was a pleasant surprise even to me. I\u2019ve yet to discover more of such interesting hidden use cases. While some might naturally call it scope creeping (and yes that is true, given that we had a deadline, and a play-pretend client-business relationship with the course team), I saw it as an opportunity for exploration and research. Frankly, I AM personally very keen about researching stuff! I am actually very thankful to the TDS course team & @s.anand for devising such a thoughtful project that sparked some interesting ideas that I can tinker with. Food for thought! Really! As for my next project, I now have a fair idea of what I\u2019ll be experimenting with\u2014 modalities. PS: I\u2019m not claiming it\u2019s perfect or production-ready, or it should score a perfect 22/20, but it aligned well with what I believe was the spirit of these projects: thoughtful use of LLMs in agent design . At this point, I\u2019m less concerned about the marks, I\u2019m actually enjoying the thought joyride. TL;DR My approach doesn\u2019t rely on regex or hardcoded mappings. Instead, it passes user input directly to an LLM, which then plans and executes workflows using general tools inside a containerized environment. It also learns from feedback and iterates \u2014 much like a human. The fact that it can do more than just the minimum spec is a byproduct of that framework. I\u2019ve only just wired the pieces together.

Steps Taken to Replicate the Test Environment I cloned my repository using: bash\ngit clone <my_repo_url>\ncd <my_repo_directory>\nI built the Docker image using:\n\nbash\ndocker build -t.\nI ran the Docker container with:\n\nbash\ndocker run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000\n\nI ensured that datagen.py and evaluate.py were placed in the same folder as instructed.\n\nFinally, I ran the evaluation script using:\n\nbash\nuvicorn evaluate.py --email=<any_email> --token_counter 1 --external_port 8000 Issue with Original Submission After reviewing the evaluation logs, I identified that the issue with my original submission was caused by binary incompatibility between pandas (version 2.0.3) and NumPy (version 1.24.3). These versions worked perfectly during development on my local machine and were tested multiple times across both Linux and Windows platforms before submission. Even after pulling the submitted Docker image from Docker Hub post-submission, it worked without any issues locally. However, during your evaluation, this incompatibility caused the container to fail. I acknowledge this issue, have fixed it in my updated submission, and previously conveyed this in my earlier message. Action Taken To address this issue, I made a small adjustment to my requirements.txt file to explicitly fix these versions for compatibility across all environments. This was the only change made to my submission. After rebuilding the container with this updated file, I tested it again thoroughly in your replicated test environment, and it worked as expected: The application initializes correctly on port 8000 within 5 minutes. It responds to requests within the required timeframe. I have pushed this updated image to Docker Hub under the same repository: Docker Hub URL: santoshsharma003/tds-project-one-1:latest Request for Re-Evaluation I kindly request that you pull the latest version of my Docker image from Docker Hub and re-run the evaluation process. I understand that deployability is being tested, and I have taken every necessary step to ensure that my submission now works in any environment, including replicating your test setup exactly. Previous Message for Reference For your convenience, here is my earlier message explaining this issue in detail: \"Greetings, Sir, I would like to bring to your notice a problem with my original submission of the Docker container. During evaluation, a binary incompatibility between pandas and numpy caused the container to fail. To my surprise, the same versions (pandas==2.0.3 and numpy==1.24.3) were working fine while developing on my local machine. I also tested it with the same Dockerfile on both Linux and Windows platforms using these versions, and it was functioning correctly before pushing and submitting it. I checked the other day after pulling the Docker image from Docker Hub following the submission, and it worked at that time as well. To resolve this issue, I adjusted the Dockerfile to explicitly fix these versions, rebuilt the container, and conducted further testing locally. The application now correctly initializes on port 8000 and returns expected responses within the required 5-minute timeframe. I\u2019ve pushed the updated image to Docker Hub (santoshsharma003/tds-project-one-1:latest).

We will get in touch shortly.", "@carlton @jivraj @s.anand , I hope you\u2019re doing well. I wanted to humbly request a reconsideration regarding the evaluation of my project submission. I understand there was an issue with building the Docker image from the repository. However, I had successfully built and pushed the Docker image earlier, and I believe it demonstrates that my solution is deployable. If the final evaluation was solely based on building from the repository, I\u2019m a bit confused about why the Docker image was considered earlier and why we were also asked to upload it to Docker Hub if it wasn\u2019t going to be taken into account later. Also the earlier evaluation score where we got some marks at least and now are hopes are crushed after one night. I do realize that in the real world, these kinds of errors can be critical, and I truly appreciate that the course is structured to prepare us for such expectations. That said, this course has been quite challenging, and for many students\u2014including myself\u2014it has been a source of considerable stress and demotivation. I sincerely request that you kindly consider awarding some partial marks for the working Docker image that was built and pushed earlier. It does reflect an understanding of deployable solutions, which I\u2019ve worked hard to demonstrate. I know you all have our best interests in mind, and I\u2019m grateful for the efforts put into making this a rigorous and enriching course. My only concern is that such harsh penalties\u2014especially for a single oversight\u2014can significantly affect our CGPA and future opportunities. I hope my request can be considered with empathy.

This structure allows the run.py file to run the project without any issues by calling the appropriate functions from app/main.py .

And datagen.py (or a similar named file which we will not tell you ahead of time and will be provided as the query parameter in task A1) will normally be called by evaluate.py Inside the docker container, permission for the data folder is set by the Dockerfile which then allows your application to access the root folder inside your docker image and create the /data folder. So the workflow is like this (for your internal testing only\u2026 please follow the Project page for deliverables and evaluation to submit project successfully): You create your application server that serves 2 endpoints on localhost:8000 You create a docker image that runs this application server. You run the docker image using podman as described in the project page. For mimicking the testing conditions. You need two files: evaluate.py and datagen.py to be in the same folder where you are running these two scripts. Run evalute.py using uv. If your docker image is correctly configured and your application is correctly configured, then all the tasks run by evaluate.py will correctly tell you if the application is producing the right result for each task.

Warm regards, Mishkat Chougule", "I hope this message finds you well @jkmadathil sir. Firstly, I would like to sincerely apologize for any misunderstandings that may have arisen. I have the utmost respect for the grading system and for the esteemed professors at IITM, and I deeply value the effort put into the course. However, as a student, I am hoping to clarify the criteria for earning bonus marks in the TDS course. Addressing the queries you raised in your post: What is the policy related to bonus for Diploma level courses as per grading policy document? In previous modules, such as Project 1, bonus marks were awarded for completing additional tasks (1 bonus mark per task if the code handled them correctly). Similarly, in GA4, bonus marks were given for replying in Discourse. These bonus marks, however, were specific to the respective modules and did not affect the final grading. What is the policy adopted in previous instances of TDS? I am not fully aware of the policies adopted in previous terms for the TDS course. Did anyone read the text related to bonus marks associated with GA7? I have read the email regarding GA7 and the associated bonus marks. The email states that: Dear Learner, DEADLINE: 10th April, 2025 23:59:59pm GA7 requires you to submit 3 peer evaluations, so that you may be graded for your submission. Please find the form link below to submit your evaluations. https://forms.gle/DhBW4xdKyv7hXhXD9 AFTER completing your initial 3 peer reviews which were sent in the previous email, if you submit 5 additional reviews, you will be awarded upto 5 BONUS MARKS to your final T score. For example if your final TDS score is 75, doing all 5 extra peer reviews can boost your final score in TDS to 80. You will have to submit the form 5 times (1 for each peer). Use the same form link to submit 5 different reviews. Your Bonus score will still be based on the metrics derived for the initial 3 peer reviews, but scaled for 5 peer reviews. You have been given the peer submissions as links to HTML files which you have to download and view in a browser. Does anyone know what should be done to get the bonus? From the information in the email, I infer that students who complete the additional reviews are eligible for bonus marks, which will be added to their overall total marks. Has anyone inquired about effort involved in getting the bonus? My peers and I have worked diligently to complete all required tasks, including the ROE and projects. Earning additional bonus marks is certainly a challenging milestone, and we understand that it requires considerable effort. After answering all the above, has someone actually tried to follow instructions in the \u201cmail\u201d to get the bonus? Unfortunately, I can\u2019t follow the instructions because I did not receive the email about submitting extra peer reviews, as it appears to have been sent to those who participated in GA7. \u2026 Given this context, I would appreciate it if you could kindly clarify the situation for students who completed all GAs from 1 to 6 (or did their best 4 GAs) but did not participate in GA7. Specifically, I would like to understand why only those who completed GA7 are receiving the bonus marks email regarding peer reviews. Please note that I ask this purely for clarification and with the utmost respect for the professors and the grading system, as I have no intention of creating controversy. I simply wish to understand the criteria. Thank you for your time and consideration @jkmadathil sir. Best regards, Akshit Mittal", "23f2004636: From the information in the email, I infer that students who complete the additional reviews are eligible for bonus marks, which will be added to their overall total marks.

And believe me, we are also learning in the process.", "Yes @jkmadathil sir, I did receive this email from one of my peers, although we are not closely acquainted, making it difficult to complete a review with the peer who shared the email. Since the beginning of the course, it has been emphasized that the TDS course focuses more on teamwork and collaborative learning than individual study. I fully believe this concept and worked together with my group. I created Colab files for 4 GAs for my peers(more than 250 peers must have benefited from it), and my peers supported me with Project 1 and 2. They were mainly responsible for helping me score the full marks in the first two minutes of the ROE release and we had a meeting after ROE, which was scheduled with you. I understand that earning bonus marks for GA7 will be difficult. However, I had no opportunity to participate in this process even after submitting six GAs, while attempting only GA7 (which I understand presents a slim chance) may grant me 5 bonus marks. I acknowledge that the chances are difficult, but many of my peers who didn\u2019t submit GA7, including myself, feel we deserve an opportunity. Sir, I am not questioning the grading system but I think it would have been helpful if we had known earlier that peer reviews in GA7 would be part of earning bonus marks. In GA4, Anand Sir made it clear that anyone who asked or answered a question in the GA4 discussion would receive bonus marks but these were specific to GA4 (e.g., a score of 110 out of 100), not the overall grading. To be clear, my query is why I am not being afforded the opportunity. I believe there may have been some confusion or lack of clear communication regarding the bonus system. I am not pointing out mistakes, but I just feel the information about the bonus could have been shared more clearly. Finally, I want to thank everyone with whom I have connected during this course. I am not questioning why others who submitted GA7 are eligible for a bonus, but I am simply asking why I am not eligible, especially after submitting six GAs, the ROE, and two projects. I know that the world is much more than 5 marks, but I am only seeking clarity on the situation. I\u2019d also like to mention that with the end-term exams just three days away, most of us will be focusing on preparing for them. However, I trust you\u2019ll definitely take our concerns into consideration, and we remain hopeful for clarity regarding the bonus marks. Thank you once again for your understanding.", "Hello sir, I too did not do the GA7 since the best 4 out of 7 would be considered and I had my college examinations during that time. I was not aware that doing reviews for GA7 would grant bonus marks and I have not received any mails regarding it.", "I agree with all my peers. If there was a bonus on the course grade T which would make a huge difference on the final grade I think it should have been told to us upfront.", "Bonus marks criteria should have been clarified before the deadline of week 7 GA so we all could have attempted it.", "It\u2019s really unfair. We were not aware that doing reviews for GA7 would grant bonus marks and we have not received any mails regarding it. You could have informed us beforehand. 5 marks really makes a huge difference. I trust you guys to make it fair for everyone", "It is good to see that you have been actively collaborating with your peers and both have benefitted from this. Here is the main query that most people are having: 23f2004636: To be clear, my query is why I am not being afforded the opportunity. I believe there may have been some confusion or lack of clear communication regarding the bonus system. Here is my response, and I have consulted with the course instructors before sharing this: Every term in TDS, both instructors and students are not aware of what bonuses are going to be given out at the start of term. Bonus activities are created at any point, at the discretion of the course team, and the information is not disseminated in a wide fashion. It\u2019s primarily a reward mechanic for those that really are interested in engaging in the whole breadth of the course. For instance, in the last two terms the bonus activities required them to post their solutions in Discourse where the problem statement. The course team do not invent GAs for the sake of giving opportunities for scoring marks. They are opportunities to learn and put that learning to use. Another goal is for the GAs to be opportunities to learn by collaborating with each other. 192 students took that opportunity to engage with GA7. If no one is interested in doing the GA, then why should the team take the effort to create it? Would you rather prefer that we make it mandatory for all students to do all GAs (by making GAA = average of all GA Scores)? Some courses do that. We were very lenient in our GA scoring because the course is tough. Students benefitted from that leniency. Should we reverse our leniency so that everyone \u201cgets the opportunity to get bonus marks?\u201d Think about this As a course team, they did not know beforehand that they were going to give opportunities for any bonuses when GA 7 was created. So there was no information to give. Please do understand that the course team do not knowingly hide things from students (that\u2019s a viewpoint that some students seem to suggest with their posts or at least). When we saw that some students were taking the effort to do GA7, we decided that we would give them an opportunity as a reward for their diligence, to try and obtain some bonus marks. Are you jealous of their diligence? It is extraordinary that it appears you would prefer if those students, who actually put in the effort, would not be given the opportunity! You have not been able to avail the opportunity because you decided that doing GA 7 is not worth the effort at all. They thought it was worth the effort before there was any chance of a bonus. And now you begrudge them that reward for their own diligence. Once again reiterating this point - Bonus marks are given for activities to students at the discretion of the course team. It always has been. And it has never been widely available to all students in past terms of TDS either. This term is no exception. They are never decided beforehand. They are created as and when there seems to be an appropriate opportunity to reward students for their effort. The 192 students that decided to do GA7 deservedly have that opportunity. But it\u2019s not guaranteed for them either. They have to put in a significant coordinated effort with their peers to actually achieve that. In other words, it\u2019s not a freebie. I had promised to provide the distribution of people who did GA7 both in terms of number of assignments done and average score in GAA. Here is the data below: # Assignments Done # students 0 42 1 33 2 22 3 19 4 23 5 28 Assignment_Score # students 0-10 75 11-20 19 21-30 15 31-40 9 41-50 13 51-60 7 61-70 11 71-80 12 81-90 10 91-100 17", "Thank you for sharing the data @jkmadathil Sir The data clearly supports my assumption that the majority of students attempted GA7 primarily to secure 100% in GAA, or  to boost their GAA scores, with learning being a secondary priority. Anyway, it is what it is. Thankyou Sir", "Exactly and no one cares about that fact or try to understand it.", "@jkmadathil Sir , Thank you for the detailed explanation. I just have one sincere doubt: As you mentioned, the intention behind the GA7 bonus is to reward extra effort in GAs\u2014but why are 5 bonus marks being added to the total course marks , instead of awarding 15/100 of the total to those who did GA7 exceptionally well? Students like me, who have consistently scored 100% in all GAs (excluding GA7) and have been actively participating in the Discourse forum from the beginning, seem to be left out. Don\u2019t we deserve some recognition for our consistent efforts too? It\u2019s not about jealousy\u2014it\u2019s about acknowledging those who have put in their day and night from the start, completing every GA diligently and earning bonus marks as per the criteria already defined for earlier GAs. I\u2019m only concerned about my own marks , and I just wish for a fair system that values consistent effort across the term. Thank you for your time and understanding. @carlton @Jivraj", "Exactly my point, there is no mention about this. Bonus marks should be added out of 15 and not above that for T score calculation. Otherwise it SHOULD mentioned in Grading Document.", "Thanks for the clarification. I completely understand that bonus marks are at the discretion of the course team and are meant to reward diligence and deeper engagement \u2014 which is fair. However, I just want to point out a potential nuance: Many of the 192 students who did GA7 may have done so not for extra learning but simply to ensure their top 4 GAs included 4 full scores (e.g., to replace a lower-scoring GA). So the distinction between diligence-for-learning and diligence-for-grade-maximizing becomes blurred. Now that bonus marks are announced after the deadline, those who already had 4 perfect scores and skipped GA7 based on the stated structure (top 4 out of 7) are essentially penalized for playing the game by the original rules \u2014 not for a lack of diligence or engagement. I\u2019m not questioning the bonus system itself, just pointing out that such surprises can unintentionally favor certain strategies over others \u2014 and more transparency around this in future terms might help students make better-informed decisions without second-guessing themselves later.", "Sir, why is GA7 given the atmost priority and the bonus of GA7 is not awarded to GA7 alone but is awarded as bonus to the entire total score of the course. If the team wants to award the bonus marks for the consistent performance then they should consider the best 5 or 6 GAs and award bonus accordingly. It is unfair that those who just attempted GA7 are been given bonus marks to the entire course. If you wish to provide bonus marks then provide the bonus marks for GA7 alone, the same way as it was done for GA4. The main issue is that the bonus marks concept was never informed prior. The team should not take actions at random as it would affect many students. As per grading document, only best 4 out of 7 GAs were supposed to be considered. Even if the team wishes to give the bonus mark then it should be given to the GA7 alone and not entire total score. Sir as per the current logic, say a person just attends GA7 alone and doesnt attend any another thing then he would also be awarded bonus 5 marks to his total score just because of the fact that they attended GA7. Whereas students who have been submitting Ga1 to 6 and werent able to submit GA7 alone as per current logic are not being considered for the bonus mark. This is unfair. Please think from our side. Regards Karthik", "jkmadathil: When we saw that some students were taking the effort to do GA7, we decided that we would give them an opportunity as a reward for their diligence, to try and obtain some bonus marks. Are you jealous of their diligence? @jkmadathil Sir, this sounds reasonably fair. But, what about the students who were lethargic in probably week 1 or week 2, thinking that they can solve the GAs of later weeks? They also get benefitted from this. I think the attitude of these students is the same as those who skipped GA& as they got 100% GAA within the first five or six weeks", "I wanted to follow up on my previous message regarding the 5 bonus marks for GA7 and further elaborate on the impact this may have on overall grades. As outlined in the grading document, the best 4 out of 7 GA assignments carry a total of 15 marks. Since many students, including myself, scored well in our best 4 assignments, which were prioritized as we aimed to maximize our grades, we did not attempt GA7. The bonus marks for GA7 were announced after the deadline, which has led to a concern that this may create an imbalance in the overall grading. For students who excelled in their top 4 assignments, the additional 5 marks from GA7 may not significantly alter their overall grade, as they have already demonstrated strong performance. Conversely, those who struggled initially and attempted GA7 in hopes of improving their grade may benefit more from this bonus. This could inadvertently disadvantage those of us who strategically focused on the highest scoring opportunities available to us. Given that the bonus marks were introduced after grades were finalized, I respectfully ask if there\u2019s a possibility to consider an adjustment in these", "Thank you for taking the time to respond in detail. I\u2019d like to respectfully share a few clarifications in response to some of the points raised. jkmadathil: When we saw that some students were taking the effort to do GA7, we decided that we would give them an opportunity as a reward for their diligence, to try and obtain some bonus marks. Are you jealous of their diligence? With due respect sir, I want to clarify that in my original message, I stated: \u201cI am not questioning why others who submitted GA7 are eligible for a bonus, but I am simply asking why I am not eligible\u2026I know that the world is much more than 5 marks, but I am only seeking clarity on the situation.\u201d As mentioned above, my intention was never to express jealousy . It was simply an enquiry for clarity, especially around the communication and criteria related to the bonus system. The assumption that those who did not attempt GA7 chose not to put in effort is not accurate, respectfully. jkmadathil: You have not been able to avail the opportunity because you decided that doing GA 7 is not worth the effort at all. I would like to point out that many of us, myself included, showed consistent diligence by completing and submitting GA1 through GA6. Personally, I solved GA5 and GA6 even after solving my Best 4 GAs purely for the learning experience , knowing they wouldn\u2019t necessarily impact my grade directly. I never avoided GA7 out of carelessness\u2014I simply prioritized the fact that only the best 4 GA scores would count. This is not a lack of effort or interest in the subject matter. Further, you mentioned: jkmadathil: The 192 students that decided to do GA7 deservedly have that opportunity. I completely respect the effort put in by those students. However, I would like to offer another perspective: what if some among those 192 had not completed their best 4 GAs prior to GA7? Meanwhile, those of us who consistently completed all previous GAs(excluding GA7) from the start are now excluded from this opportunity\u2014not due to lack of interest, but due to lack of communication. If the bonus is truly a recognition of effort specific to GA7 , then it might be more fair to reflect that in the GA7 score only, not in the overall course total , which affects students who were consistently involved across the term. I know I\u2019m still learning and have a long way to go\u2014there\u2019s so much about the world, professionalism, and fairness that I hope to understand better through experiences and guidance of professors and through the exposure from the college. But I also believe that seeking clarity is part of that learning. Thank you once again for reading my message and considering my point of view.", "Thank you for the response sir, however my doubt was regarding a different issue. It is not that I am jealous of their diligence or anything, its simply that even from the data you provided above, it seems that a majority of students, 141 out of the 192 students have not actually even done 4 assignments. So they might have done GA7 for the 4 GAA criteria, not just due to diligence. Once again I am not stating that they were all like that, but rather it is a possibility. Another issue is that a lot of students might have originally worked hard on earlier assignments to score well but may not have had the time for later assignments such as college students like myself who have end term examinations ongoing currently. Since I saw that I had already put in the effort to do all 6 assignments prior, I only did not do the GA7 since it clashed with my examinations. Once again I am not blaming the instructors for this situation sir but the bonus 5 marks can very well change which grade we get in the end, which is the reason why I have created this message. The students who have attempted GA7 do deserve extra marks for their work but if others were informed of the extra 5 marks then we may have also taken part in it, even if we had other prior commitments. Thank you once again for reading this message sir and kindly consider our point of view.", "@jkmadathil @carlton @s.anand @Jivraj Sir, as said in this another students\u2019 post, i would also like to bring your notice to the fact that most of those 192 students who attempted the GA7 have not done 4 assignments. This shows their \u201cdiligence\u201d which you are awarding them for. Whereas the students like us who have been submitting all the projects and the assignments GA1 to 6, how can the team conclude that just because we didnt submit GA7 we are not diligent enough to be awarded the bonus marks. Shouldnt the bonus marks be awarded to those students who have been submitting literally all 2 projects and 6 assignments(6/7 i.e 85% of the assignments)? How could the team decide to award bonus 5 marks to the overall score just to those students based on a single assignment( namely GA7).  We are genuinely struggling, and we are requesting bonus marks based on that. Please don\u2019t misunderstand our request as jealousy \u2014 it comes from a place of hardship. How can a student who submitted 1 assignment make him more diligent than those who have been submitting 2 projects and 6 assignments. I think if you plan to award bonus marks you should consider best 5 or 6 assignments and not just based on a single assignment. Just because we didnt submit a assignment(GA7) why are we being deprived of the bonus marks which was not even informed of. If you want to provide the bonus marks then you can also consider the best 4 assignments as well as it would also show the students\u2019 interest and diligence as you said. If you want to consider for the bonus marks you can consider any assignment right, why just GA7 is the question. You can also award the bonus marks based of GA-1 or GA-2 or so. I think the diligence which are talking of, should be measured based on consistent performance and not just based on a single assignment. Regards Karthik", "@carlton @jkmadathil @s.anand sir, We have sent a couple of messages regarding the fairness of bonus marks to the above discourse post but no satisfactory reply has been provided. Could you please look into it and provide an update. We appreciate fairness in this matter.", "@s.anand Sir, I just wanted to request you to kindly look into the matter regarding the GA7 peer review bonus marks. Many of us are still waiting for a response on Discourse, and it\u2019s becoming a bit concerning. Would really appreciate it if you could help us get some clarity on this. Thank you! Mishkat Chougule", "Hi everyone, A bit of data might be useful. Its been interesting reading all your posts, I thought I might share some brief insights. Firstly students vastly overestimate the ease of getting bonus marks in TDS. So of the approx 200 students that did GA7: The top bonus mark was 3. Only 2 students managed it. Going by that statistic, of the 600 students who are active in TDS, possibly 6 might have even managed to get 3 or more marks. So lets not pretend that this was easy by any stretch of the imagination. The mean bonus score was 1.27. So, on average, you would get less than a 1/3rd GAs worth of marks for the extra effort of an entire GA+extra work. The psychology study it revealed however is interesting on this thread to see. The difference between perception and reality. My advice is stop reacting emotionally and evaluate rationally. That is the data for you. Student Bonus 600\u00d7371 7.62 KB Also noteworthy Bonus marks in TDS are never made known ahead of time for any term in the past and neither will it be in the future. None of us knew that there were going to be bonuses after the submission of GA7. Please stop requesting, \u201cat least you should let us know before GA7\u201d. How can we let you know, if we ourselves were not aware there were going to be bonus marks? Bonuses are always surprise opportunities that are not widely available to everyone. For example we never release them on the seek portal. In the past Anand has released them on discourse, where typically, in previous terms, less than a fraction of a third of the students are even engaged, let alone active. Of course students in the past complained saying, they did not know and were not informed. To which the response was, maybe you should be more actively engaged on discourse. How many people typically tried TDS bonus in the past? Probably around 50. So compared to previous terms, this term is a huge improvement! Bonuses are not a right. They are opportunities that become available for those that are engaged with the course. Where and when that opportunity becomes available varies. A bit like real life. However we have read all your concerns and we have decided to put a disclaimer in the grading document for future terms: Opportunities for bonus marks might become available for activities linked to any of the GAs, Projects or Course Modules. The may be revealed at anytime, on any platform (seek, discourse, course site) and through any medium (official email, discourse) at the discretion of the course team. Bonus marks are not guaranteed and are awarded at the discretion of the course team.", "@carlton Could you explain why so few students got good bonus marks? What was the criteria by which they were given?", "The rubric is challenging and requires some level of collaboration with others. Thats why the bonus marks are low. Also the there is minimum requirement for even being eligible for it, i.e. you must complete GA7 and give 3 peer reviews before you can even be considered for bonus eligibility.", "Hi @carlton sir and @Jivraj sir, Sir, As per your instructions, I had reached out to my peers well in advance; however, only 3 out of 8 responded. While 2\u20133 of the worksheets were publicly accessible, many remained private despite the ample time provided. This raises the possibility that the individual assigned to grade those particular sheets\u2014aside from myself\u2014may also not have had access, potentially affecting the overall grading accuracy. Additionally, I noticed that some worksheets were largely incomplete or just a single sheet was provided, and there is a chance that a few participants may have copy-pasted their own values because the if the sheet were provide and access wasn\u2019t given, the probability of the correct values being there was really high, which could further influence the evaluations. Admittedly there were quite a lot of empty sheets too which I gave zero as deserved but this might not have been the case with other evaluators. Given these factors, I wanted to kindly request clarification on how these were handled. Was there a specific threshold required to qualify for the bonus, and how are such inconsistencies accounted Sir, some of us(including me) have submitted all 7 GAs and despite the end term we approached peers and completed all 8 reviews even when we had already got 90-110 in first four with average being 100 so I hope we could be graded fairly and appropriately for our efforts.", "I am frankly surprised by this outcome. I don\u2019t see how there could have been large variances in scores different evaluators would have given to a student. I hope the data is not being skewed because of the  total number of evaluations being low, or because of differing perceptions about how a student needs to be scored, or any other reason.", "SIGMA ADMIN", "Thank you for raising a proper point about the fairness of the issue. The  course\u2019s rules  seems to be changed on a whim, which is pretty unfair to those of us who completed the first 6 assignments properly. If anything, why not inform the +5 bonus before declaring the GA-7. \u201cRewarding diligence\u201d is a vague point as completing 6 out of 7 assignments requires a decent commitment to the course. Getting rewarded for completing all 7 assignments is something absolutely commendable, without a doubt but getting a +5 on the basis of simply GA-7 is vague because it doesn\u2019t guarantee the commitment towards the other 6 assignments.

The limited time you have to use GPT effectively. It will help you with minor work flows, but not with complex tasks. (watch the session debrief to hear a clear articulation about this).

What is unusual is to have a preview of it before ROE. So the discussions were very intense even for us. Today\u2019s Mock ROE will be more like a traditional solving session and deal with new aspects. It has the added bonus of being hosted on an exam server (without a time limit).

Due to the volume of the content in the first 3 weeks it was decided to at least get students sufficient information to be able to do the Graded Assignments. One of the criticisms we received last term was that the sessions were too slow because we were covering from the very basics. So it was a conscious decision to speed up and shorten the explanations. Of course this is always difficult to get right because we respond to students in sessions. This is why attending the sessions is more valuable than watching the sessions. We cannot effectively gauge what level to pitch at if the audience is silent or not involved. We can only guess the level of the vast silent mass of students. The quality of sessions only improve when the sessions are interactive and well attended. Have you watched this session in particular? If thats insufficient for you last term we did a 2hr 48 min session on just introducing it followed by another 2 hour detailed explanation of the more advanced use cases But of course does everyone want to watch 5.5 hours of sessions to understand it?
